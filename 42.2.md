## Generation of Charts and Tables (Presentation &ndash; Part 2) [M2]

### PivotTables

In some cases, standard cell layouts or Excel tables don't provide enough flexibility when showing data, which is where PivotTables can be used. These allow a range of data to be selected and then used in a table that can be quickly changed. By dragging arrays of data to areas of the table (*Column Headers*, for example), one can build complex tables quickly, and these can be fine tuned by filtering the data shown by various methods or sorting the headers of the table rows.

#### Charts and Graphs

PivotTables bring their own kind of charts and graphs into Excel, separate from the standard ones. These are built to update as the information in the PivotTable they're mapped to changes. This dynamic design can be useful particularly when the dimensions of a table are changing.

## Automating Tasks in Excel: A Comparison [M3]

Macros can be used in Excel to automate processes. In our scenario, a macro written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to take data written in the visitor form and place it on a separate, hidden worksheet. This spreadsheet would only be unlocked by the macro as data was being entered, meaning that users of the form cannot tamper with the information others have submitted.

### Buttons

In Excel, a number of form controls exist, each available in standard Excel form and ActiveX versions. The former is implemented directly into the application and is more basic. These form controls allow you to take input and create a submit button, for instance, but in order to change the colour or style of the box, one must look to ActiveX form controls. These allow far more properties to be changed, altering both their appearance and functionality.
