## Presentation

### Part 1: Data Analysis for Marketing [Part of P4]

Judging by the number of visitors to the UK from each of the listed countries per year, I suggest that it would be most beneficial to target marketing towards the following countries, in the specified languages:

| Country			| Visits per year	| Language											
|-------------------|------------------:| --------
| France			| 3930396			| French
| Germany			| 3161980			| German
| USA				| 2790504			| English, Spanish
| Irish Republic	| 2394513			| English, Irish (Gaelic)
| Netherlands		| 1921942			| Dutch, Frisian
| Spain				| 1704476			| Castilian Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Basque
| Italy				| 1665808			| Italian
| Poland			| 1357008			| Polish
| Belgium			| 1188322			| Dutch (Flemish), French
| Australia			| 1069962			| English

This data was found using a Top 10 conditional formatting rule across all of the data for total visits. This allowed me to select the countries that supplied the highest amount of visitors to the UK per year and isolate it. I then sorted the results by the number of visitors, and consolidated the language data I found on [infoplease.com](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0855611.html).

In order to show the seasonal trend in the amount of visitors to the UK in each purpose category I plotted a graph with four lines, showing the visitor count for each quarter of the year.

The chart on the right shows the proportion of visitors from each geographical region 

### Part 2: Generation of Charts and Tables [M2]

Excel can be used to create rich visualisations of data, allowing users to create pie charts, line graphs and histograms.

#### PivotTables

In some cases, standard cell layouts or Excel tables don't provide enough flexibility when showing data, which is where PivotTables can be used. These allow a range of data to be selected and then used in a table that can be quickly changed. By dragging arrays of data to areas of the table (*Column Headers*, for example), one can build complex tables quickly, and these can be fine tuned by filtering the data shown by various methods or sorting the headers of the table rows.

PivotTables bring their own kind of charts and graphs into Excel, separate from the standard ones. These are built to update as the information in the PivotTable they're mapped to changes. This dynamic design can be useful particularly when the dimensions of a table are changing. A PivotChart was used in the `42.2.xlsm` spreadsheet to show data as a pie chart.

## Automating Tasks in Excel: A Comparison [M3]

Macros can be used in Excel to automate processes. In our scenario, a macro written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to take data written in the visitor form and place it on a separate, hidden worksheet. This spreadsheet would only be unlocked by the macro as data was being entered, meaning that users of the form cannot tamper with the information others have submitted.

### Buttons

In Excel, a number of form controls exist, each available in standard Excel form and ActiveX versions. The former is implemented directly into the application and is more basic. These form controls allow you to take input and create a submit button, for instance, but in order to change the colour or style of the box, one must look to ActiveX form controls. These allow far more properties to be changed, altering both their appearance and functionality.
