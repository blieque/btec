## Uses of GIFs [P3]

The GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a type of image used primarily on the web, developed by CompuServ, end released in 1987. The format was used extensively on the web until the introduction of the PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format, as it supports transparency. When the PNG format was released in 1996, designers were able to use alpha transparency, meaning each pixel of an image could assume any of 256 levels of opacity, whereas with GIF each pixel was either opaque or transparent. GIFs were used for icons on websites even after the introduction of PNGs, but are now primarily used for their animation capabilities.

Animation was introduced to GIF images with a secondary version (named *89a*, as opposed to the original *87a*), which was released in 1989. This led to a huge number of animations to be created, and a new community to emerge on the web. GIFs could suddenly be used to tell short stories, and quickly people began to distribute them widely. Soon after, browsers started to support the animated images and in turn make the sharing of GIFs even easier. This is now standard in all major browsers, at the desktop and on mobile. Because of this support offered for animated GIFs, they are one of the most compatible ways to show a motion graphic on the web.

GIFs are known, however, to be inefficient for sharing animations, as the file sizes of animated GIFs are usually large given their dimensions and number of frames when compared to more advanced formats such as WebM video and better compression codecs.

There is a lot of controversy over the pronunciation of the formats acronym and common name. The majority of people pronounce the letters as would seem standard, using a hard *g* sound. Others compare the name to that of the peanut butter brand *Jiff*, claiming that it was the intended pronunciation as [clarified by the author](http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/) of the format. When he was [presented with a Webby Award](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22620473) in 2013, he generated a huge response on Twitter from his reiteration that most were pronouncing the name "wrong".
