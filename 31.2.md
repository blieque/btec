## Uses of GIFs [P3]
<!-- 513 words -->

The GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a type of image used primarily on the web, developed by CompuServ, end released in 1987. The format was used extensively on the web until the introduction of the PNG (Portable Network Graphic) format, as it supports transparency. When the PNG format was released in 1996, designers were able to use alpha transparency, meaning each pixel of an image could assume any of 256 levels of opacity, whereas with GIF each pixel was either opaque or transparent. GIFs were used for icons on websites even after the introduction of PNGs, but are now primarily used for their animation capabilities.

Animation was introduced to GIF images with a secondary version (named *89a*, as opposed to the original *87a*), which was released in 1989. This led to a huge number of animations to be created, and a new community to emerge on the web. GIFs could suddenly be used to tell short stories, and quickly people began to distribute them widely. Soon after, browsers started to support the animated images and in turn make the sharing of GIFs even easier. This is now standard in all major browsers, at the desktop and on mobile. Because of this support offered for animated GIFs, they are one of the most compatible ways to show a motion graphic on the web.

GIFs are known, however, to be inefficient for sharing animations, as the file sizes of animated GIFs are usually large given their dimensions and number of frames when compared to more advanced formats such as WebM video and better compression codecs. They are also limited by the number of colours that they support. Each GIF image can only display up to 256 colours, but these colours can be chosen from a palette of over 16 million. Applications that can create as GIFs, such as Photoshop, will typically evaluate the image and pick the 256 most useful colours in order to maintain quality. A technique called dithering will also likely be used, meaning gradual changes in colour will be a lot less noticeable.

GIFs are also limited when it comes to transparency. If a user wishes to include transparency in an image, one of the 256 colours picked for the image will have to be sacrificed. This is because transparency is considered a colour in the GIF format, unlike with the PNG format in which transparency is encoded using an alpha channel.

There is a lot of controversy over the pronunciation of the formats acronym and common name. The majority of people pronounce the letters as would seem standard, using a hard *g* sound. Others compare the name to that of the peanut butter brand *Jiff*, claiming that it was the intended pronunciation as [clarified by the author](http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/) of the format. When he was [presented with a Webby Award](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22620473) in 2013, he generated a huge response on Twitter from his reiteration that most were pronouncing the name "wrong".


## HTML/JavaScipt/SVG and Flash: A Comparison [M2]

On the web, animations have a great number of uses. Perhaps their most common use is to show activity as a page or resource is loading. Although rare on the modern web, loaders can still be seen when viewing more data intensive media, such as video or large images. GIF animations are used extensively on image sharing websites such as Imgur, often showing short clips made by users or from popular films and TV shows. A lot of animations have been uploaded to YouTube too, and communities have emerged of people sharing their creations, usually created In Adobe Flash Professional.

### HTML, JavaScript and SVGs
<!-- 839 words -->

Although the SVG, or scalable vector graphic, format was introduced in 2001, it's only in the last few years that the developers of the major browsers &ndash; Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Opera Software and Apple &ndash; have put effort towards fully supporting the file type. The format allows webmasters to embed vector images in websites and, thanks to their XML architecture, modify them with JavaScript and style them with CSS. Using delayed loops in JavaScript and mathematical interpolation, SVGs can be animated, leading to a very rich experience. Used in conjunction with parallax scrolling effects and responsive design elements, a very impressive effect can be created, as shown excellently by the Garden web design agency's [portfolio website](http://gardenestudio.com.br/en).

Despite the advantages of animation using SVG, they are still not common on the web, and are typically found on a select few tailor-made websites. SVG animation is also in early days, and although SVG animations are very efficient, perform well, and offer much better browser support than Flash, the possibilities are somewhat limited. SVGs were not created with the intention of being used as a medium for animation, and JavaScript does not have animation functionality by default. SVG animation usually consists of gradually changing stroke and fill parameters on particular paths. Unlike in Flash, in which each frame is stored separately, SVG animations are able to play at the highest framerate supported by the device showing them.

In order to create animations and websites to display them, all one realistically needs is a modern web browser and a good text editor. There are plenty of tutorials online, and the documentation provided by the W3C and by Mozilla via its [developer network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is detailed and easy to work with. Graphical software can also be used to ease the creation of SVGs that can then be animated.

### Flash

In order to create Flash projects, one realistically needs tailor-made software. Although free alternatives do exists, Flash Professional is the industry standard application, developed by Adobe alongside the Flash specification and player. This was previously all developed by Macromedia, but Adobe acquired the rival in late 2005. The need for software behind a pay-wall makes the format a lot less accessible to the majority of budding designers, forcing them to either spend more than they're comfortable spending; pirating the software and consequently breaking the law; or using sub-par software which would likely have a negative impact on their workflow and productivity. Free alternatives include programs such as [Synfig](http://www.synfig.org/cms/), advertising itself as open-source animation software.

A completed game or animation made in flash is typically exported from Flash Professional as an SWF. This is a **s**mall **w**eb **f**ormat object, which can be embedded on websites using HTML or viewed using a standalone player or web browser. In order to view Flash objects, in order to play games or most video on the internet, one must have a plugin installed for their browser, otherwise it must be built in. In the case of Internet Explorer, the Windows version of Flash will suffice. Chrome instead comes packaged with a third-party Flash player called PepperFlash, which aims to perform better than the official Adobe software. By including its own players, Chrome also brings flash support to Linux, which Adobe ceased to support in February 2012. This requirement to have extra software installed just to view some web content makes the use of Flash undesirable; many developers and enthusiasts frown upon the use of Flash on the web. The dependency on software that is gradually losing support from Adobe is pushing browser developers to implement HTML5 and CSS3 specification, and the usage of Flash is quickly declining.

### Versus

Advances brought by HTML5 nullified many of Flash's advantages by providing more up-to-date and compatible replacements. On the modern web very few tasks truly require Flash. Although the vast majority of games are still written in Flash, these could be written using HTML5 technologies. One of the most prominent features in Flash still in use is the ability to copy information to the system clipboard, which is required by websites offering a "copy to clipboard" button for a particular piece of information. This is not available using HTML and JavaScript as it presents a security flaw to an ever-more hostile web.
