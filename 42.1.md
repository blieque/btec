# Unit 42 &ndash; Spreadsheet Modelling
### Assignment 1: P2, M1, P3

## Presentation of Data [P3,M1]

There are four files attached below. The first is the main spreadsheet, the second is the Excel theme I designed and used, the third is the PDF handout version of the presentation worksheet in the main workbook, and the alst is the logo I used in the spreadsheets.

<div class="f">
	<a href="/btec/f/42.1.xlsx">42.1.xlsx</a>
	<a href="/btec/f/42.1-theme.thmx">42.1-theme.thmx</a>
	<a href="/btec/f/42.1-handout.pdf">42.1-handout.pdf</a>
	<a href="/btec/f/42.1-logo.png">42.1-logo.png</a>
</div>
