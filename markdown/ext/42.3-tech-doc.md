### Exporting to CSV

In order to export the data collected from visitors to the tourist information office each month, follow the steps below:

1. Firstly, the spreadsheet containing the data must be un-hidden. In order to allow worksheets to be hidden and un-hidden, navigate to the *Review* tab in the ribbon and click on *Protect Workbook*, which should already be highlighted. The password to allow this is simply `password`.

2. We must now un-hide the database sheet, by right-clicking on the *Form* worksheet tab in the bottom left, clicking *Unhide*, selecting the *Form Database* worksheet, and then clicking OK. The results should now be shown on screen.

3. To export the data, click *File* on the ribbon, and then *Save As*. In the dialogue box that appears, select _CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)_ in the *Save as type:* drop-down menu. Give the file a name and choose where to save it on your computer. Once this is complete, click the *Save* button in the bottom right.

4. Remove the protection on the database worksheet, by navigating to the Review tab once more and clicking *Unprotect Sheet* button. Again, the password is `password`. This allows us to remove the data in the spreadsheet.

5. Select the data columns by clicking and dragging the mouse right-wards from the column A label to the column I label. This selects all of the data provided by visitors, regardless of how far down the spreadsheet it it.

6. Right click anywhere in the selected area, and then click *Clear Contents* to remove all user-submitted information. Place the selection in cell A1 before proceeding.

7. Re-protect the spreadsheet by clicking the same button used to un-protect it previously, now labelled *Protect Sheet*, and untick the two selected tick boxes. Enter `password` in the password entry box, and click OK. At this point you will be prompted to repeat the password you entered.

8. Right-click on the database spreadsheet label in the bottom left, and click *Hide*, and then click *Protect Workbook* in the *Review* tab. Enter `password` once more and confirm it when prompted.

9. Save the spreadsheet and exit. Send the CSV file generated by Excel to the database manager.

Alternatively, you may instead only proceed to step three, then close Excel without saving changes. Delete the Excel spreadsheet, and then re-download it from the file-server it was originally obtained from. This will give you a fresh copy, with workbook structure and password protection already configured as it should be.
