# Written Communication

As an example of how encoding of a written communication can be changed in order to convey a different message, both explicitly and implicitly, I looked at  articles from two different news outlets reporting on the same event. In an [article](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/12/11/cheney-defends-cia-interrogation-techniques-calls-senate-report-flawed/) titled "Cheney defends CIA interrogation techniques, calls Senate report 'deeply flawed'", an unnamed Fox News writer describes the political conflict between ex-vice president of the USA Dick Cheney and Senator Dianne Feinstein regarding the recent senate report on interrogation techniques used by the CIA.
