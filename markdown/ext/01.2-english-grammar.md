# Overly Long Sentence

The following has been re-written, as the sentence was initially too long.

> In previous years, it may have been that a doctor &ndash; although unable to cure a patient's problem &ndash; would still have visited them regularly in order to provide emotional support. This contrasts with the world today, in which patients undergoing treatment with complex technology, for instance, would not receive the same personal aspect of treatment. This could be interpreted to imply that the system is less humane or compassionate than it once was.
