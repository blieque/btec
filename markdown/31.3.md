### Second Animation; in Maxon Cinema 4D

<div class="i h">

	The animation begins with the camera not yet rotated around (0,0,0) at all. The six softbox lights are shown in an even distribution around the scene. At the centre is a blue, reflective sphere, hovering above the ground by about it's own radius. A much larger softbox is situated above the scene, and is visible in the reflection of the main sphere. The scene immediately begins to rotate at a steady pace (using linear interpolation) and 100 smaller spheres become visible, falling down and towards the original sphere. 80% of the smaller spheres are lime and reflective, and 20% are lit with a bright lime colour (likely appearing as a light yellow/cream colour).

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.4.png">
	The smaller spheres continue to fall and curve towards the larger sphere, as though lightly magnetic. The momentum from falling causes some of the spheres to fall past the larger sphere, but these proceed to rise again and the spheres distribute themselves over the large sphere evenly.

	After a moment, the attraction of the larger sphere suddenly drops, and the smaller spheres fly away. This is partially due to the upwards momentum many of them have, as well as the lowered global gravity acting on the scene. As the smaller spheres move away from the centre of the scene, they're sizes decrease at differing rates and times. This creates an interesting set of frames to exit the animation. Thirty frames before the end of the animation the top half of the scene will begin to display the beginning of the animation again, creating a overlapping loop. The animation will be rendered 30 frames longer than the final GIF, and the overlap will be implemented in Adobe After Effects CC post-production.

## Production of Animation [P7]

### First Animation; in Flash

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.3.gif">
	<object data="/btec/file/31.3.3.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="396" height="223"></object>
	On the left is the first animation, exported from Flash Professional as a GIF. The right-hand version is an SWF, embedded with an HTML <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element.
