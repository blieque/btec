## Design of Animation [P6]

	The scene is a deserted assault course, taking on the theme of a skateboard park. The course is made up of a series of shapes, representing blocks of concrete. There are also some second-layer components, such as supports for raised parts of the course and a latter in the top right. Pieces of graffiti are scattered around on the blocks, and develop the urban, skateboarding theme. The animation begins as a stick figure runs into the frame from the top left.

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.04.png">
	The figure runs with exaggerated movement, jumping high with each running step. Upon reaching the end of the first platform, the character jumps head-first into the first curve of the course, and slides around to the bottom. Although perhaps unrealistic, I like the motion of this move.

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.06.png">
	The figure then continues off of the first curve into open air, where it performs a rotation of about 45&deg;, incorporated into a full flip. The character then falls down to the bottom of the frame, sliding slightly on the sloped and curved floor. It then begins to run towards the left of the frame, and consequently up the second curved ramp in the scene.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.08.png">
	After running around the second curve of the course, the character jumps over to a wall roughly in the middle of the frame horizontally, sitting on the floor of the scene. After performing another flip, this time only rotating about 200&deg;, the character grabs onto the top of the wall.

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.10.png">
	After pulling itself over the top of the wall, the figure falls down on the other side. The figure quickly gets up again, and runs forward to the flight of stairs. It proceed to climb the steps in a similar exaggerated manner to the running previously. The steps are taken two-at-a-time.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.11.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.12.png">
	Upon reaching the top of the flight of stairs, the character jumps up the wall and then pushes away towards the next platform. The figure prepares to catch the ledge while flying through the air, and does so, swinging and then climbing up to the platform.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.14.png">
	The figure then leaps once more, this time onto the ladder positioned nearby. The figure climbs up the ladder, and onto the last and highest platform. From here the figure leaves the scene, by jumping from the ladder and rolling in the process. By the time the character has recovered from the roll, it has left the scene.

### Second Animation; in Maxon Cinema 4D

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.2.png">
	The animation begins with the camera not yet rotated around (0,0,0) at all. The six softbox lights are shown in an even distribution around the scene. At the centre is a blue, reflective sphere, hovering above the ground by about it's own radius. A much larger softbox is situated above the scene, and is visible in the reflection of the main sphere. The scene immediately begins to rotate at a steady pace (using linear interpolation) and 100 smaller spheres become visible, falling down and towards the original sphere. 80% of the smaller spheres are lime and reflective, and 20% are lit with a bright lime colour (likely appearing as a light yellow/cream colour).

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.3.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.4.png">
	The smaller spheres continue to fall and curve towards the larger sphere, as though lightly magnetic. The momentum from falling causes some of the spheres to fall past the larger sphere, but these proceed to rise again and the spheres distribute themselves over the large sphere evenly.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.5.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.6.png">
	After a moment, the attraction of the larger sphere suddenly drops, and the smaller spheres fly away. This is partially due to the upwards momentum many of them have, as well as the lowered global gravity acting on the scene. As the smaller spheres move away from the centre of the scene, they're sizes decrease at differing rates and times. This creates an interesting set of frames to exit the animation. Thirty frames before the end of the animation the top half of the scene will begin to display the beginning of the animation again, creating a overlapping loop. The animation will be rendered 30 frames longer than the final GIF, and the overlap will be implemented in Adobe After Effects CC post-production.

## Production of Animation [P7]

### First Animation; in Flash

#### Process of Creation

The first step in creating the animation was to open Flash and create a new ActionScript 3 Flash project. The stage, as it is referred to in Flash, was then resized to less than 300 pixels wide, and adjusted to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Using the brush tool and a Wacom bamboo drawing tablet, I drew the main lines of the scene. I made use of the Shift key to lock the brush to 45&deg; angled lines, making the horizontal and vertical lines much easier to draw. I used a very dark grey for the main lines. These lines also stretched outside of the stage, and I drew lines completely outside of this area to create closed areas for the blocks of the assault course. I then used the fill tool, using a a lighter-grey colour, to complete the blocks, and started on the secondary-layer items.

Using a lighter grey than the original lines, I drew the ladder and the supporting strut using the pen once more. I used the Shift key for both, when drawing long lines. For parts, such as the rungs of the ladder, I just drew by hand and judged by eye. Using colours and different sized brushes (and the Shift key to an extent once more), I added graffiti. I had no intention of creating readable words or recognisable imagery, but rather simple colourful, shapes resembling street art, achieved in part by the thin running paint lines below the shapes. The graffiti-style words were added in the three locations I had specified with rectangles on the storyboard images, evenly distributing them across the scene.

Once the scene had been established I moved on to character animation. I created a new layer and switched on onion skinning, which makes the previous and next frame(s) faintly visible. This is greatly useful in creating smooth animation and consistent movement patterns during different parts of the animation. Using the F6 and F7 keys on the keyboard, I moved through the animation frame-by-frame. Only at two consecutive points did I extend a drawing beyond a single frame, and this was during a moment of very little movement. In retrospect, I feel I would have created a higher quality animation had I drawn every twentieth frame, perhaps, and then created the tweens afterwards. This would have led to a less fluctuating overall size of the character and a better overall speed to the animation.

Once all of the frames had been drawn I added padding frames at the end, allowing for a few blank frames in the animation before it looped. I then exported the animation from Flash Professional as an SWF (small web format), which can be easily embedded in websites. This is the standard output format for Flash-based creations. To simply distribute the <code>*.fla</code> file that Flash saves as is not sufficient, as the Flash Professional application is required in order to open the file. SWFs, on the other hand, can be opened by Adobe Flash Player, which runs as a plugin in the case of most modern browsers. Links to both the project file and flash object are given below.
