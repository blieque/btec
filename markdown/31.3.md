	The scene is a deserted assault course, taking on the theme of a skateboard park. The course is made up of a series of shapes, representing blocks of concrete. There are also some second-layer components, such as supports for raised parts of the course and a latter in the top right. Pieces of graffiti are scattered around on the blocks, and develop the urban, skateboarding theme. The animation begins as a stick figure runs into the frame from the top left.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.03.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.04.png">
	The figure runs with exaggerated movement, jumping high with each running step. Upon reaching the end of the first platform, the character jumps head-first into the first curve of the course, and slides around to the bottom. Although perhaps unrealistic, I like the motion of this move.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.05.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.06.png">
	The figure then continues off of the first curve into open air, where it performs a rotation of about 45&deg;, incorporated into a full flip. The character then falls down to the bottom of the frame, sliding slightly on the sloped and curved floor. It then begins to run towards the left of the frame, and consequently up the second curved ramp in the scene.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.07.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.08.png">
	After running around the second curve of the course, the character jumps over to a wall roughly in the middle of the frame horizontally, sitting on the floor of the scene. After performing another flip, this time only rotating about 200&deg;, the character grabs onto the top of the wall.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.10.png">
	After pulling itself over the top of the wall, the figure falls down on the other side. The figure quickly gets up again, and runs forward to the flight of stairs. It proceed to climb the steps in a similar exaggerated manner to the running previously. The steps are taken two-at-a-time.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.12.png">
	Upon reaching the top of the flight of stairs, the character jumps up the wall and then pushes away towards the next platform. The figure prepares to catch the ledge while flying through the air, and does so, swinging and then climbing up to the platform.

	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.1.14.png">
	The figure then leaps once more, this time onto the ladder positioned nearby. The figure climbs up the ladder, and onto the last and highest platform. From here the figure leaves the scene, by jumping from the ladder and rolling in the process. By the time the character has recovered from the roll, it has left the scene.

	The animation begins with the camera not yet rotated around (0,0,0) at all. The six softbox lights are shown in an even distribution around the scene. At the centre is a blue, reflective sphere, hovering above the ground by about it's own radius. A much larger softbox is situated above the scene, and is visible in the reflection of the main sphere. The scene immediately begins to rotate at a steady pace (using linear interpolation) and 100 smaller spheres become visible, falling down and towards the original sphere. 80% of the smaller spheres are lime and reflective, and 20% are lit with a bright lime colour (likely appearing as a light yellow/cream colour).

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.3.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.4.png">
	The smaller spheres continue to fall and curve towards the larger sphere, as though lightly magnetic. The momentum from falling causes some of the spheres to fall past the larger sphere, but these proceed to rise again and the spheres distribute themselves over the large sphere evenly.

</div>
<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.5.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/31.3.2.6.png">
	After a moment, the attraction of the larger sphere suddenly drops, and the smaller spheres fly away. This is partially due to the upwards momentum many of them have, as well as the lowered global gravity acting on the scene. As the smaller spheres move away from the centre of the scene, they're sizes decrease at differing rates and times. This creates an interesting set of frames to exit the animation. Thirty frames before the end of the animation the top half of the scene will begin to display the beginning of the animation again, creating a overlapping loop. The animation will be rendered 30 frames longer than the final GIF, and the overlap will be implemented in Adobe After Effects CC post-production.

## Production of Animation [P7]

### First Animation; in Flash

#### Process of Creation

The first step in creating the animation was to open Flash and create a new ActionScript 3 Flash project. The stage, as it is referred to in Flash, was then resized to less than 300 pixels wide, and adjusted to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Using the brush tool and a Wacom bamboo drawing tablet, I drew the main lines of the scene. I made use of the Shift key to lock the brush to 45&deg; angled lines, making the horizontal and vertical lines much easier to draw. I used a very dark grey for the main lines. These lines also stretched outside of the stage, and I drew lines completely outside of this area to create closed areas for the blocks of the assault course. I then used the fill tool, using a a lighter-grey colour, to complete the blocks, and started on the secondary-layer items.

Using a lighter grey than the original lines, I drew the ladder and the supporting strut using the pen once more. I used the Shift key for both, when drawing long lines. For parts, such as the rungs of the ladder, I just drew by hand and judged by eye. Using colours and different sized brushes (and the Shift key to an extent once more), I added graffiti. I had no intention of creating readable words or recognisable imagery, but rather simple colourful, shapes resembling street art, achieved in part by the thin running paint lines below the shapes. The graffiti-style words were added in the three locations I had specified with rectangles on the storyboard images, evenly distributing them across the scene.

Once the scene had been established I moved on to character animation. I created a new layer and switched on onion skinning, which makes the previous and next frame(s) faintly visible. This is greatly useful in creating smooth animation and consistent movement patterns during different parts of the animation. Using the F6 and F7 keys on the keyboard, I moved through the animation frame-by-frame. Only at two consecutive points did I extend a drawing beyond a single frame, and this was during a moment of very little movement. In retrospect, I feel I would have created a higher quality animation had I drawn every twentieth frame, perhaps, and then created the tweens afterwards. This would have led to a less fluctuating overall size of the character and a better overall speed to the animation.

Once all of the frames had been drawn I added padding frames at the end, allowing for a few blank frames in the animation before it looped. I then exported the animation from Flash Professional as an SWF (small web format), which can be easily embedded in websites. This is the standard output format for Flash-based creations. To simply distribute the <code>*.fla</code> file that Flash saves as is not sufficient, as the Flash Professional application is required in order to open the file. SWFs, on the other hand, can be opened by Adobe Flash Player, which runs as a plugin in the case of most modern browsers. Links to both the project file and flash object are given below.

#### Testing

Test | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome
-|-|-
Does the animation meet it intended purpose? | The animation was supposed to entertain or educate a child. | I feel the animation would entertain children, if for a limited amount of time. There's also the possibility that the animation could inspire a child to pursue a sport such as freerunning or parkour.
Are there any errors in the animation? | The animation should not be subject to errors. It should, by default, play and loop once completed. | I didn't notice any kind of error in the animation when I viewed it embedded in this page. A direct link given further down the page to the SWF should be opened by a browser and displayed without issue. If this is not the case, it is the fault of the browser, and I recommend the use of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
Is the animation file size suitable for use on the web? | The animation was created using the tools in Adobe Flash Professional. This means that each frame's data is stored in a vector-based format, not raster. This is much more space efficient, and I would be surprised if the final animation was more than 200 KB. In comparison, RAW still photos from a DSLR can easily reach 10 MB. | The final animated Flash object stands at only 38 KB. To put this in perspective, just the text for other assignments, such as Unit 2 Assignment 2, have reached 46 KB.
Is the framerate suitable? | The animation is set at thirty frames-per-second, meaning that the animation should appear smooth at full speed, while not overloading the image viewing engine processing it. | I found that although some less capable machines were significantly impacted when displaying the GIF on screen, as shown by CPU load and temperature, the GIF could easily be played for a suitable period of time.
Does the animation play in a web browser? | Yes, by use of the Adobe Flash Player plugin used to display SWF objects. | As expected.

#### Feedback

In order to help gauge the success of the animation, I asked for feedback from peers.

* **How does the animation compare to the storyboard design?** &mdash; The animation follows the frames shown in the storyboard and accurately represents it.

* **Does the animation meet it intended purpose?** &mdash; Although the animation would not be classed as educational, but I feel the animation was entertaining and achieves its purpose as a result. Initially the outcome of the animation is unclear, making it more interesting.

* **Are there any errors in the animation?** &mdash; The animation plays smoothly and appears to be of a sufficient framerate. Only the figure moves, and the animation could be made more interesting by letting the environment change as well, but the animation is successful nevertheless. The frames do not flicker and there are no broken frames, which is good.

* **Do you have any suggestions for improvement?** &mdash; The animation could be made more successful with the addition of a partially animated environment. For example, the concrete in the top right could crack or collapse as the character lands on it, forcing the figure to find another route out of the scene.

### Second Animation; in Maxon Cinema 4D

#### Process of Creation

The first step was to open Cinema 4D and save immediately. This allows quick saving using keyboard shortcuts whilst creating the animation. I then started to create the scene; I created the main sphere and imported the large softbox from a lightkit created by a Cinema 4D tutorial videographer on YouTube. I also added a seamless floor, which ensures that the horizon of the infinite floor is not noticeable. I changed the colour of the floor to a dark grey in the process.

I then continued to build the scene, adding the large sphere in the centre, adding dynamics tags (enabling physics simulation), adding the smaller spheres and key-framing the attraction of the centre sphere and the size of the smaller spheres. I modelled the light positioned around the scene using a series of primitive shapes, such as cuboids and cylinders. At the time, I was less experienced, and used a luminous material on the front of the light, but I now know this to be less effective and more demanding on the renderer than using actual area lights in the same position. Luminosity can still be used for the appearance of the lights, but should have no actual lighting impact. Once I had created a single softbox that I was content with, I used cloner object to radially duplicate the original around the centre of the scene. This allows for perfect distribution and easy control over other variables such as the distance from the centre. Using a cloner also means that only the original need change, and the whole group will change as well.

After this, I went on to create the textures for all of the objects in the animation. I added five small spheres to a cloner object, and added a luminous texture to one of the five. This resulted in 20 of the total 100 spheres glowing. I added a Fresnel effect to the reflective objects to make them more realistic. Once the animation using keyframes was complete, and I was happy with the result, I started adjusting the render settings. This included setting an output path for the rendered frames (a sequence of `*.png` images), setting the width and height of the frame, enabling advanced light calculation (*Global Illumination* in Cinema), enabling ambient occlusion, raising the anti-aliasing level (allowing for more clear reflections) and changing other settings to reduce the render time. Once this was complete I added the project to the queue and let the images render. Each frame, rendered at 480p (853 &times; 480 pixels), took around a minute and a half to render, bringing the total render time to over an hour.

Once the images had finished rendering I opened After Effects and began post-production. The images were first imported and strung together into an animation, and the default length of the composition After Effects had created was reduced as I was going to overlap the animation with itself and create a close loop. After duplicating the animation on the timeline, I created the loop. I first moved the duplicate so that it would end thirty frames after the main copy started. I then used a keyframed mask to clip the duplicate in such a way that it wouldn't interfere with the animation starting above. This almost failed as one of the small spheres moved very close to the bottom of the top softbox as more spheres were due to fall. Had the sphere been one frame slower in its size decrease, the quality of the overall animation would have suffered.

After the loop overlap was complete, I decided to add some basic colour correction. I used gradient maps and different blending modes such as *Screen* and *Overlay* to change the tint of particular colours in the animation. I also adjusted more traditional values, such as contrast, brightness and saturation. Once this was complete, I exported the composition from After Effects to a QuickTime (`*.mov`) video clip using the MPEG-4 codec. In order to generate the final GIF, I used Photoshop. Although many users are not aware of the fact, Photoshop can be used to process video, and does this proficiently. The animation was imported and then, using the *Save for Web...* dialogue, exported as an animated GIF image. Using this save feature in Photoshop naturally creates images close to there most optimised potential. This means that the final GIF cannot realistically be made smaller without impacting performance or image quality.

#### Testing

Test | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome
-|-|-
Does the animation meet it intended purpose? | The animation was supposed to entertain or educate children. | I feel that the animation is entertaining and interesting to watch. The animation could potentially spark interest in a child regarding magnetism and gravitational fields too. Cinema 4D could also be used to simulate the orbits of planets in space should it be required to, which could be useful educationally.
Are there any errors in the animation? | The animation should be largely error free, and should play. There may have been some slight errors in composition however. | The animation plays and does not have any glaring graphical errors. That said, the background of the scene does change lightness quite drastically through the animation. This is due to the new spheres under the light appearing instantly, and blocking out the light. The issue was somewhat corrected in post-production using After Effects, but the change in lightness is still easily noticed.
Is the animation file size suitable for use on the web? | The final animation should be manageable in terms of file size, but the age of the GIF format will likely result in a large file. | The final GIF consumes 3.4 MB of digital space, which I believe to be acceptable for a GIF animation. The format is dated and does not compress the data efficiently, compared to modern video clip standards. Although the size is not ideal, the compatibility that the format offers outweighs the drawback.
Is the framerate suitable? | The animation was created at thirty frames-per-second. I would expect this to be sufficient and allow the animation to appear smooth when running. | The animation appears as expected and runs at the intended 30 frames-per-second, or at least not significantly slower. This means that the motion plays smoothly and individual frames are not noticeable.
Does the animation play in a web browser? | Yes, as all modern browsers have support for animated GIFs. | As expected. The GIF can cause a drop in performance on some computers, but this is not drastic.

#### Feedback

In order to help gauge the success of the animation, I asked for feedback from peers.

* **How does the animation compare to the storyboard design?** &mdash; The is a difference between the final animation and the initial storyboard in that the balls were designed to fall on the floor once the larger ball stopped pulling them towards it, but they instead dissipated through the air around the ball.

* **Does the animation meet it intended purpose?** &mdash; The animation does achieve its purpose as it entertains, and has potential to educate. For example, it could be used in a science lesson to visualise gravity among a number of objects.

* **Are there any errors in the animation?** &mdash; No, the animation plays smoothly without any flickering or noticeable frame changes, and the loop is seamless.

* **Do you have any suggestions for improvement?** &mdash; Instead of simply attracting all of the smaller balls to the centre, they could bounce around the scene, and deflect off of the softboxes.
