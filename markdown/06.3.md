# Planning a Program [P6]

> * Paradigm choice

> 	* Too simple a program for objects, really

# Data Type and Software Structure Choice [M2]

# Quality and Readability of Source Code [M1] [D1]

> Using examples of code, explain the difference between good code and bad code (M1). Describe how factors such as commenting, naming conventions for variables and functions, indentation and consistent spacing can improve the readability and comprehensiveness of code (D1) and the importance of good documentation. Include an overall evaluation of your own solution &ndash; listing where it has or hasn't succeeded in meeting these standards.

> Your analysis of good and bad code should take the form of a word-processed document *(lolwut)*, with screen-shots of commented code, possibly from your own recent work. You may also want to include samples of flow-charts and other forms of documentation.  

# Blackjack in Python [D2]

* Steps

In order to show the flow of the program as it would run, I created a flow diagram, shown below. The labelled parts of the diagram are described below.

1. A message being outputted to the user.
2. A decision being made based on user input.
3. A decision being made based on the value of a stored variable.
4. A decision being made based on user input, potentially causing the program to loop.
5. The end of the program being reached, resulting in it quitting.

In order to further understand the flow of data around the program before writing pseudo-code, I decided to design a data flow diagram, which is shown below.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/06.3.1.svg">
	A DFD, or data flow diagram, showing how data may move around a Blackjack program.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Blue</strong> &ndash; The main program runtime and the game function (<code>game()</code>).</li>
		<li><strong>Purple</strong> &ndash; The variables available throughout the application, such as the number of wins for the player and dealer.</li>
		<li><strong>Hot Pink</strong> &ndash; Input from the keyboard connected to the system, processed by the operating system and passed to the program.</li>
		<li><strong>Red</strong> &ndash; The output of the program, shown to the user in a command-line window. This may also be saved to a file or processed by another program, depending on implementation of the blackjack program.</li>
		<li><strong>Orange</strong> &ndash; The code called to send the logo banner as text to the output when the program launches.</li>
		<li><strong>Marigold</strong> &ndash; A function called by the main process to generate a random card.</li>
		<li><strong>Yellow</strong> &ndash; A function that is passed an array of known cards, before returning their value. If any of the cards are aces, the function will either ask the user to choose how many points to add, or decide for the AI based on the value of other variables.</li>
		<li><strong>Lime</strong> &ndash; A function that accepts an array of scores, and which then generates a score table using box-drawing characters and prints it to the output.</li>
		<li><strong>Green</strong> &ndash; A function used to add ANSI escape codes before and after a string of test. This is disabled if Windows is detected.</li>
	</ul>

* Pseudo-code

In order to show the use of algorithms, functions, variables, user interaction and more, I build Blackjack digitally, using Python. The code I wrote is shown below, which will work optimally on both Linux/OS X and Windows. When using a terminal emulator that properly supports ANSI escape codes and Unicode is available, such are used. On Windows, escape sequences are disabled and DOS characters are used in place of their Unicode counterparts. You can also use *Right click > "Save link/target as..."* on [this](/btec/file/code/06.3-blackjack-win.py) link to download the script.
