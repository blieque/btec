* Steps

* Flow

* Pseudo-code

In order to show the use of algorithms, functions, variables, user interaction and more, I build Blackjack digitally, using Python. The code I wrote is shown below, which will work optimally on both Linux/OS X and Windows. When using a terminal emulator that properly supports ANSI escape codes and Unicode is available, such are used. On Windows, escape sequences are disabled and DOS characters are used in place of their Unicode counterparts. You can also use *Right click > "Save link/target as..."* on [this](/btec/file/code/06.3-blackjack-win.py) link to download the script.
