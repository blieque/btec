# Planning a Software Solution [P6]

## Analysis

### Questionnaires, Surveys and Market Analysis

### Data Flow

In order to better understand the flow of data around the program, I designed the data flow diagram shown below.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/06.3.1.svg">
	A DFD, or data flow diagram, showing how data may move around a Blackjack program.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Blue</strong> &ndash; The main program runtime and the game function (<code>game()</code>).</li>
		<li><strong>Purple</strong> &ndash; The variables available throughout the application, such as the number of wins for the player and dealer.</li>
		<li><strong>Hot Pink</strong> &ndash; Input from the keyboard connected to the system, processed by the operating system and passed to the program.</li>
		<li><strong>Red</strong> &ndash; The output of the program, shown to the user in a command-line window. This may also be saved to a file or processed by another program, depending on implementation of the blackjack program.</li>
		<li><strong>Orange</strong> &ndash; The code called to send the logo banner as text to the output when the program launches.</li>
		<li><strong>Marigold</strong> &ndash; A function called by the main process to generate a random card.</li>
		<li><strong>Yellow</strong> &ndash; A function that is passed an array of known cards, before returning their value. If any of the cards are aces, the function will either ask the user to choose how many points to add, or decide for the AI based on the value of other variables.</li>
		<li><strong>Lime</strong> &ndash; A function that accepts an array of scores, and which then generates a score table using box-drawing characters and prints it to the output.</li>
		<li><strong>Green</strong> &ndash; A function used to add ANSI escape codes before and after a string of test. This is disabled if Windows is detected.</li>
	</ul>

### Requirements

## Design

### Flow

### Functions, Variables and Their Types

Variable naming and types, functions, and pseudo-code are all covered in the [D2 task](#2).

### Interface Design

## Build

koading!

## Testing

Using common techniques for testing, I was able to verify the functionality of the Blackjack program continuously. Based on the findings from my testing, I was able to improve the program and fix bugs.

### Plan

What/how will we test?

### Results

What did we notice?

### Report of Findings

What did we find? (meaning of observations)  
What did we do?

## Evaluative Report

Boring.  
Boring.  
Boring.

# Planning Functions, Variables and Their Types [D2]

## Pseudo-Code

Before writing the application in Python, I wrote some snippets of pseudo-code to further understand some particular parts of the program.

## Data

### Integers

* **`card`** &mdash; An array storing two integers. These are the indices of a card's suit and 

* **`suit`** &mdash; 

* **`value`** &mdash; 

* **`card_new`** &mdash; 

### Booleans

* **`game_over`** &mdash; 

* **`dealer_cont`** &mdash; 

* **`windows`** &mdash; 

### Strings

* **`wins_string`** &mdash; 

* **`wins_split`** &mdash; 

* **`choice`** &mdash; 

* **`action`** &mdash; 

* **`card_name`** &mdash; 

* **`play_again`** &mdash; 

* **`wins`** &mdash; 

### File Objects

* **`wins_file`** &mdash; 

In order to understand the data that would move around the Blackjack program, I wrote a list of variables that I would use, along with their data types.

<!-- ## Choice of Tools

> * Paradigm choice
> * Language choice
> 	* Too simple a program for objects, really
> 		* Although, `card` class with suit, number vars + `getValue`, similar methods
> * Text editor/IDE -->

# Quality and Readability of Source Code [M1] [D1]

> Using examples of code, explain the difference between good code and bad code (M1). Describe how factors such as commenting, naming conventions for variables and functions, indentation and consistent spacing can improve the readability and comprehensiveness of code (D1) and the importance of good documentation. Include an overall evaluation of your own solution &ndash; listing where it has or hasn't succeeded in meeting these standards.

> Your analysis of good and bad code should take the form of a word-processed document *(lolwut)*, with screen-shots of commented code, possibly from your own recent work. You may also want to include samples of flow-charts and other forms of documentation.  

# Flow and Something [D2]

In order to show the flow of the program as it would run, I created a flow diagram, shown below. The labelled parts of the diagram are described below.

1. A message being outputted to the user.
2. A decision being made based on user input.
3. A decision being made based on the value of a stored variable.
4. A decision being made based on user input, potentially causing the program to loop.
5. The end of the program being reached, resulting in it quitting.

# Blackjack Python Script

In order to show the use of algorithms, functions, variables, user interaction and more, I build Blackjack digitally, using Python. The code I wrote is shown below, which will work optimally on both Linux/OS X and Windows. When using a terminal emulator that properly supports ANSI escape codes and Unicode characters, such are used. On Windows, escape sequences are disabled and DOS characters are used in place of their Unicode counterparts. You can also use *Right click > "Save link/target as..."* on [this](/btec/file/code/06.3-blackjack-win.py) link to download the script.
