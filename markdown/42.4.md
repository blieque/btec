## Problem Solving with Spreadsheets [P1]

Spreadsheets offer an easy way to process a great amount of data in a number of different ways with ease. For many small- to medium-scale situations Excel or similar applications are the easiest and quickest approach in order to generate manageable and easily understood statistics. Excel can also be used to create forms for data input, as demonstrated in an [earlier assignment](/btec/42.2), as well as to generate sample data to use for other tasks.

### Goal Seek

A form of "what-if analysis", Goal Seek in Excel allows the value of a particular cell in a spreadsheet to be changed without affecting the spreadsheet permanently. This means that the user can view the spreadsheet as it would appear if different data had been entered in the worksheet. This is useful for projection of results and the success of a business, for example. Goal Seek is able to automatically change the value of one cell until the value of another equals a predetermined desired value.

### Generation of Data

As an example, a developer may be building an application to handle numbers in a particular way, such as decide whether the given number is odd or even. In order to test the application with a batch of values the user could enter 

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/42.4.1.1.png">
	<img src="/btec/img/42.4.1.2.png">
	Use of the <code>FLOOR()</code>, <code>RAND()</code> and <code>ISEVEN()</code> functions to generate a column of random integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The <code>CEILING()</code> function is not used as a value of zero returned by <code>RAND()</code> would cause an output of zero, which is lower than the intended minimum. 1 has been added to the result of <code>FLOOR()</code> so that the final result can reach 1000, and the lowest does not drop below 1.

</div>

With the formulae above, the developer could generate a great batch of integers and whether or not they're even. These could then be fed through the application and the results compared with the output from Excel. This would allow the efficiency and accuracy of the application to be analysed, as well at its performance when processing a great amount of data.

## Data Interpretation in Business [D1]

The core purpose of Excel is to make the collection, management and modifications of data easier, and to enable people to quickly draw conclusions from the information. In order to make data interpretation and presentation easier when working with great amounts of data in a business or organisational environment, a number of features have been developed for Excel.

### What-If Analysis

What-if analysis refers to the three ways in which values of cells can be temporarily changed in Excel, or order to observer the effect those changes have on the rest of spreadsheet, particularly on formulae and functions.

#### Goal Seek

As mentioned before, Goal seek allows the automatic changing of a cell's value  in order to achieve another value in another cell. Excel takes the functions in other cells into consideration, and finds the first value for one cell which would generate the desired value in another cell. Goal Seek is typically used in business contexts to estimate the number of sale required in order to reach a given profit, for example. The process behind Goal Seek is essentially is reverse-working the functions in the spreadsheet, by performing the opposite of the actions they do.
