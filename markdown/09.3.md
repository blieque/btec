# Network Security [P6]

> The client is also very concerned about the security of the new network. You need to secure the client's router by performing the following actions:

> * Implement a 'Banner Message of the Day' to deter illegal router access.
> * Ensure a password is required for terminal and console connections. This password should be encrypted.
> * Configure an encrypted password for access to the router itself and to the router configuration mode.

> You need to secure the PC that is connected to the router by installing and configuring anti-virus.

> You should take screenshots of your configuration.

In order to demonstrate the process of securing a network router and configuring a computer and switch to create a LAN, I completed the task and documented the steps I took.

# Importance of Security [M3]

<!-- 800-1200 -->

<!-- > Your client would like you to provide a Security Document, explaining:

> * the types of threats faced by organisations
> * the impact that these threats can have on a business
> * how these risks can be minimised

> You should include examples of real life threats and explain the impact these have had on a business. -->

During a time when breaching security is a thriving business, it's important to take steps to secure servers and public-facing computers, as well as codes of practice and other infrastructure. If systems are not evaluated and weaknesses identified, a network or business can be left vulnerable to attackers.

## Common Threats

There are a number of prominent types of threat commonly fallen victim to by businesses. Targeted attacks may use a combination of these in order to achieve their goal.

## Impact on Business

**Loss of reputation** is the result of almost any security breach, and is what almost all incidents boil down to. Loss of reputation will almost surely lead to a financial loss for the business in both short and long terms, and this could spell the failing of the organisation.

**Financial loss** is the effective result of reputational loss, and can lead to the failing of a business. Financial loss can come as the result of a loss of business and customers, but also as the result of paying fines and legal fees after particularly serious incidents.

## Minimising Risk

# Network Services [P5]

Networks can be used for a huge number of applications, and some of the most popular have been detailed below.

<!-- 1500 -->

<!-- > Put together a report, presentation or leaflet which explains the types of services that can be provided by a network.

> Your section on directory services should be very detailed. You should investigate and evaluate the directory services provided by a server operating system, such as Microsoft Windows 2012 Server's Active Directory. -->

## Communication

Perhaps the most common use of computer networks is communication between users. Hundreds of different protocols and applications have been built over the years to facilitate communication in a number of different forms. Among the most popular protocols are IMAP, POP and SMTP (email); IRC and XMPP (instant messaging); and HTTP(S) (world wide web).

These protocols must be implemented in pieces to software in order to be used. When running a Linux server stack, one can use Postfix and Dovecot as SMTP and IMAP/POP servers, facilitating the sending and receiving of email. Users of the Microsoft ecosystem often use the proprietary Exchange protocol &ndash; replacing SMTP, IMAP and POP &ndash; which also provides conventional protocol interfaces for clients that do not support Exchange.

## Remote Access



## File Services

The copying and moving of files between different systems is a very common need within corporate networks and across the internet. Many protocols have been designed to allow the transfer of files, commonly in both directions. In the case of SFTP, the protocol implements a client&ndash;server model, whereas BitTorrent is an example of a peer-to-peer protocol.

### SFTP

Using an SSH connection to wrap and encrypt the content transferred between computers, SFTP is more secure alternative to FTP. The use of SFTP is almost identical to the use of FTP, save for the fact that the client must be capable of public-private key encryption and potentially authentication (as key pairs can be used rather than usernames and passwords).

### BitTorrent

Although often associated with piracy 

## Application Services

Desktop and web applications can be installed on a server and accessed by clients as and when required. This makes the process of upgrading a piece of software on a network much easier, and means that applications can effectively be added to a group of computers with almost no delay.

An example of a network being used to provide access to an application can be found with the Moodle educational content/course management system (CMS). The software is freely distributed and used by a number of educational institutions, having been written in PHP. Using the CMS on a webserver and integrating the software with databases and file storage infrastructure allows for students and faculty to easily manage learning resources and assignment deadlines. The software is accessed using a web browser which will connect to the webserver using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. The nature of this method of accessing software means that with minimal extra work, the CMS can be made accessible outside of an organisation's or institution's intranet and via the world wide web. By employing the right security practices, this can be made perfectly secure, and makes working outside of hours easier for students and faculty.

<!-- ## Directory Services [D2]

The lightweight directory access protocol, or LDAP, is a rule set dictating how users should be authenticated and permissions should be managed. By using LDAP to authenticate, users can be automatically logged in to a variety of other services, which is very useful in a business environment. Email opened in the browser, for example, is able to request user information from the operating system, and then use this to display the user's mail. The user could also potentially access file sharing services, remote desktop functionality and other communication infrastructure without the need to enter their user credentials more than once. If the user was not using a company computer and was therefore not using their corporate account, the services could still be made accessible after the verification of credentials. -->
