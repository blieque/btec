# Network Security [P6]

> The client is also very concerned about the security of the new network. You need to secure the client's router by performing the following actions:

> * Implement a 'Banner Message of the Day' to deter illegal router access.
> * Ensure a password is required for terminal and console connections. This password should be encrypted.
> * Configure an encrypted password for access to the router itself and to the router configuration mode.

> You need to secure the PC that is connected to the router by installing and configuring anti-virus.

> You should take screenshots of your configuration.

In order to demonstrate the process of securing a network router and configuring a computer and switch to create a LAN, I completed the task and documented the steps I took.

	In order to access the network configuration on Windows, I searched for "network" in the start menu and picked the first and only result.

	I then double-clicked the one available option, "Local Area Connection". This opened the status dialogue box for the network interface.

	An address within the universal private range was assigned to the computer. Although not required, the IP addresses for Google's public DNS servers were included in the configuration as well.

	After configuration, the <code>show running-config</code> command was used to display configuration options in use. In order for these to be used when the router were to next power on, the configuration would need to be saved.

# Importance of Security [M3]

<!-- 800-1200 -->

<!-- > Your client would like you to provide a Security Document, explaining:

> * the types of threats faced by organisations
> * the impact that these threats can have on a business
> * how these risks can be minimised

> You should include examples of real life threats and explain the impact these have had on a business. -->

During a time when breaching security is a thriving business, it's important to take steps to secure servers and public-facing computers, as well as codes of practice and other infrastructure. If systems are not evaluated and weaknesses identified, a network or business can be left vulnerable to attackers.

## Common Threats

There are a number of prominent types of threat commonly fallen victim to by businesses. Targeted attacks may use a combination of these in order to achieve their goal.

## Impact on Business

**Loss of reputation** is the result of almost any security breach, and is what almost all incidents boil down to. Loss of reputation will almost surely lead to a financial loss for the business in both short and long terms, and this could spell the failing of the organisation.

**Financial loss** is the effective result of reputational loss, and can lead to the failing of a business. Financial loss can come as the result of a loss of business and customers, but also as the result of paying fines and legal fees after particularly serious incidents.

## Minimising Risk

# Network Services [P5]

Networks can be used for a huge number of applications, and some of the most popular have been detailed below.

<!-- 1500 -->

<!-- > Put together a report, presentation or leaflet which explains the types of services that can be provided by a network.

> Your section on directory services should be very detailed. You should investigate and evaluate the directory services provided by a server operating system, such as Microsoft Windows 2012 Server's Active Directory. -->

## Communication

## Remote Access

## File Services

## Application Services

## Directory Services [D2]

The lightweight directory access protocol, or LDAP, is a rule set dictating how users should be authenticated and permissions should be managed. By using LDAP to authenticate, users can be automatically logged in to a variety of other services, which is very useful in a business environment. Email opened in the browser, for example, is able to request user information from the operating system, and then use this to display the user's mail. The user could also potentially access file sharing services, remote desktop functionality and other communication infrastructure without the need to enter their user credentials more than once. If the user was not using a company computer and was therefore not using their corporate account, the services could still be made accessible after the verification of credentials.
