# The Belbin Test

In order to analyse the ways in which we each would work best, we took the Belbin Test in class. Designed over a 9-year period by Dr. Meredith Belbin and his colleagues, the test is designed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a person relation to the workplace. By asking several questions about how one would react in given situations and the attitude one find oneself with in the workplace, the test it able to paint a picture of someone and the role they likely play at work. The test collects scores in a variety of fields which it then uses to determine which team role a person fits most, including plant, monitor evaluator, co-ordinator, resource investigator, implementer, completer finisher, team-worked, shaper and specialist. Each of these roles is accompanied by a lengthy description and list of strengths and weaknesses. Many find their Belbin test result to correlate surprisingly well with the image of themselves that they hold. Others find that the test has little merit.

## Grid

The below grid shows the two goals I have set for myself to complete within three weeks.

Time Scale | Goal
-|-
Long term  | Become a web designer/developer for an agency or myself.
Short term | Finish a website I'm currently building, and potentially build another using technologies I am currently not familiar with.

A more detailed plan of what I set out to achieve is shown below. I felt that setting a list of objectives would help to ensure that I achieve the most I can in the allotted time.

Interim Targets | Actions | Success Criteria | Review Date
-|-|-|-
Familiarise myself with the project, as I haven't had time to work on it for some time. | Read through the source code I've already written, and potentially make some readability improvements. | Being more familiar with the code I previously wrote, in order that I can continue development easily. | 31<sup>st</sup> January
