# Importing Data Into Access [M2]

The following images show the process I took to import data from a text file into a Microsoft Access database.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.01.png">
	Firstly, the importing dialogue box is opened, and the user prompted to choose the imported data's destination. This is most often a new database table.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.02.png">
	The user must give Access a reference to the file they wish to import before proceeding.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.03.png">
	Next the user is prompted to tell Access whether the data is delimited by fixed-width columns or a delimiting character (generally a comma).
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.04.png">
	One must then select how exactly the data is divided into columns. I chose <em>Comma</em> from the list of delimiters, and ticked the <em>First Row Contains Field Names</em> box. This takes the first row of the file out of the table, and uses the values as column headings instead.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.05.png">
	Next, one is able to refine the naming and data types of the columns, potentially correcting any auto-detection mistakes made by Access. I chose to change the indexing rules for the primary key column.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.06.png">
	The next step is to select a column or create a new column to hold primary key values. These are used to uniquely identify different rows of a database, meaning that no repetition is allowed. I used the <em>Stock ID</em> column for this purpose.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.07.png">
	Lastly, one must name the new table that will hold the imported data. I would normally add a <code>tbl_</code> prefix, but I did not as the table would be deleted once the contents had been analysed. Were I not going to tick the analysis wizard box at the bottom of the window, I would have added the prefix.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.08.png">
	If one ticks the analysis box in the Import Text Wizard, Access will show the Table Analyser Wizard. Here I changed the name of the main table to a more suitable one, including a <code>tbl_</code> prefix.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.09.png">
	I then selected the fields of the table that needed to be moved out. This included all of the information about item suppliers.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.10.png">
	I dragged the fields into their own table, and named it appropriately.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.11.png">
	I then set the correct field to be the primary key for the new table.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.12.png">
	Once the data had been analysed and split into the correct tables, I closed the wizard. I did not choose to save the import steps I took as the importing process was a one-off.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.13.png">
	The Table Analyser Wizard also gives the option to create a query which will show the data as it as originally imported. This would server no use in my situation, so I did not ask Access to create it.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.14.png">
	As the data had been successfully split into the correct tables, the original imported table was no longer needed, and I deleted it.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.15.png">
	Above is the final relationships diagram for the Denim Daze database.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.16.png">
	For the S-Cars database I told Access to open the data analysis wizard again, allowing me to split the data into multiple tables.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.17.png">
	I did not use the analysis wizard for the <code>tbl_drivers</code> table import. This is because there is little to no repetition in the data, and it is therefore efficient enough to begin with.

# Database Design [P2] [P3]

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.18.png">
	I started working through each table changing settings for the different fields. I changed field names while removing redundant information, added input masks to the fields, added validations rules and error text, and set most fields as required fields. The input mask shown for the <code>BookingID</code> allows for four upper-case letters followed by four numeric digits. All characters are mandatory.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.19.png">
	Although not shown in the screenshot, the ID column in the customers table would have an input mask of <code>>LLL0000!</code>, which would require three letters and four numerical digits to be entered.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.20.png">
	The National Insurance number field in the <code>tbl_drivers</code> table also uses an input mask. This required two letters to be entered, followed by eight numerical digits. A further letter is permitted, although not mandatory, as the last digit in an NIN is a checksum and is sometimes omitted.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.21.png">
	Auto-incrementation was also configured for some fields, such as the <code>ID</code> column in <code>tbl_sessions</code>. This means that every time a new record is added to the table, the primary key column is automatically generated. 
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.22.png">
	As car registration numbers do not take a consistent form, an input mask cannot be used for this field. The field settings were still changed however, making the field a required one, for example.

# Input Forms [P6] [M4]

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.24.png">
	When the Form Wizard is invoked, one must choose which fields from which table(s) and/or query(ies) to use in the form.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.25.png">
	In the case of the S-Cars database, I decided to use all of the fields available in the <code>tbl_bookings</code> table.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.26.png">
	I chose to use a basic columnar layout for the form, as it was of minimal complexity. More detailed and capable forms can utilise more suitable and user-friendly layouts.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.27.png">
	The next and final stage of the wizard allows you to give the new form a name. I chose <code>frm_bookings</code>, following the previously-used naming convention.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>

## Access SubForms

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.28.png">
	Following the initial creation of the bookings data entry form, I decided to add a sub-form. The first stage of Access' SubForm Wizard asks one to select a field or fields from tables or queries, which will become the fields shown in the sub-form.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.29.png">
	I chose to use all of the fields in the <code>tbl_sessions</code> table.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.30.png">
	When prompted by the wizard whether I wanted to create a new form or add the sub-form to an existing one, I chose the latter option, using the <code>tbl_bookings</code> table I created before.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.31.png">
	The wizard also allows one to name the new sub-form. I used <code>frm_sessions</code>, following convention as before.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.32.png">
	I also enabled conditional formatting for the <code>NumberOfPassengers</code> field in the sub-form. This makes it instantly clear which bookings have a greater or smaller number of passengers.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.33.png">
	Five value brackets were used, grouping the bookings into either the red, orange, yellow, lime or green group. A gradient colour scale would have been more suited, but this feature is only available in Excel, and not Access.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.34.png">
	Buttons, useful for a host of tasks, can be added to an Access form from the ribbon.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.35.png">
	Buttons were added to the database form allowing the user to navigate backwards and forwards through the records. Buttons were also added or going to the first and last records.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.36.png">
	Either text or an image can be used on buttons. For the navigation buttons, I chose to use icons as I feel the symbols are widely recognised enough.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.37.png">
	The button wizard also requires for buttons to be named, and I named the buttons I created with a prefix of the form name. This would make them clearly distinguishable in a list of buttons in a bigger database.
