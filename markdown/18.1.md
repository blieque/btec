# Importing Data Into Access [M2]

The following images show the process I took to import data from a text file into a Microsoft Access database.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.01.png">
	Firstly, the importing dialogue box is opened, and the user prompted to choose the imported data's destination. This is most often a new database table.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.02.png">
	The user must give Access a reference to the file they wish to import before proceeding.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.03.png">
	Next the user is prompted to tell Access whether the data is delimited by fixed-width columns or a delimiting character (generally a comma).
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.04.png">
	One must then select how exactly the data is divided into columns. I chose <em>Comma</em> from the list of delimiters, and ticked the <em>First Row Contains Field Names</em> box. This takes the first row of the file out of the table, and uses the values as column headings instead.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.05.png">
	Next, one is able to refine the naming and data types of the columns, potentially correcting any auto-detection mistakes made by Access. I chose to change the indexing rules for the primary key column.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.06.png">
	The next step is to select a column or create a new column to hold primary key values. These are used to uniquely identify different rows of a database, meaning that no repetition is allowed. I used the <em>Stock ID</em> column for this purpose.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.07.png">
	Lastly, one must name the new table that will hold the imported data. I would normally add a <code>tbl_</code> prefix, but I did not as the table would be deleted once the contents had been analysed. Were I not going to tick the analysis wizard box at the bottom of the window, I would have added the prefix.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.08.png">
	If one ticks the analysis box in the Import Text Wizard, Access will show the Table Analyser Wizard. Here I changed the name of the main table to a more suitable one, including a <code>tbl_</code> prefix.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.09.png">
	I then selected the fields of the table that needed to be moved out. This included all of the information about item suppliers.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.10.png">
	I dragged the fields into their own table, and named it appropriately.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.11.png">
	I then set the correct field to be the primary key for the new table.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.12.png">
	Once the data had been analysed and split into the correct tables, I closed the wizard. I did not choose to save the import steps I took as the importing process was a one-off.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.13.png">
	The Table Analyser Wizard also gives the option to create a query which will show the data as it as originally imported. This would server no use in my situation, so I did not ask Access to create it.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/18.1.1.14.png">
	As the data had been successfully split into the correct tables, the original imported table was no longer needed, and I deleted it.
