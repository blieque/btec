	The logo I created. I would recommend opening the image in a new browser tab by clicking it, therefore seeing the image at 1:1 scale. This is because of the pixel-art visual style I used.

To begin with, I designed a logo for a fictional game. The specification stated that the game was to be called *UFO: Invasion of Earth*, and had to include the RGB colour (170, 255, 0). It also needed to be 320 pixels wide and 240 high, at a resolution of 300 DPI or higher.

I created the image in Photoshop using a number of techniques. A number of images showing the development of the logo are shown below.

# Poster [P3]

I also designed a poster for the fictional game. Below, eight steps of progression I took are shown and explained, and the final poster is shown.

	The poster started with a blank, portrait, A4 canvas at 300 DPI. I unlocked the white background layer, and inserted it to create a black canvas. I also added some slight lighting in the lower-centre area, where the logo would be positioned. I then copied and pasted the logo from the logo document into the poster, and increased the size of the layer with the free transform feature. I made sure to use "nearest neighbour" resampling, giving the logo a retro pixel-art style. This also meant that the logo &ndash; which was only created at 320 &times; 240 pixels &ndash; would not lose quality in an ugly way.
