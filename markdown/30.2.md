# Logo

# Poster

I also designed a poster for the fictional game. Below, the eight steps of progression I took are shown and explained, and the final poster is shown.

## Progression

	The poster started with a blank, portrait, A4 canvas at 300 DPI. I unlocked the white background layer, and inserted it to create a black canvas. I also added some slight lighting in the lower-centre area, where the logo would be positioned. I then copied and pasted the logo from the logo document into the poster, and increased the size of the layer with the free transform feature. I made sure to use "nearest neighbour" resampling, giving the logo a retro pixel-art style. This also meant that the logo &ndash; which was only created at 320 &times; 240 pixels &ndash; would not lose quality in an ugly way.
