	The logo I created. I would recommend opening the image in a new browser tab by clicking it, therefore seeing the image at 1:1 scale. This is because of the pixel-art visual style I used.

To begin with, I designed a logo for a fictional game. The specification stated that the game was to be called *UFO: Invasion of Earth*, and had to include the RGB colour (170, 255, 0). It also needed to be 320 pixels wide and 240 high, at a resolution of 300 DPI or higher.

I created the image in Photoshop using a number of techniques. A number of images showing the development of the logo are shown below.

## Progression

	The logo was started using <em>Free Transform</em> in Photoshop, particularly in the perspective mode, to distort two rectangles into trapezia. In the correct position these shapes would create the illusion of a three-dimensional cuboid, two sides of which would have text lying on them. To create this text, I used similar warping methods, applied to text which I had disables anti-aliasing on. I had disabled this to achieve a retro, pixelated effect. I also spent some time creating a triangle in the top left in the colour that was required to be in the image. This would both remind me to include the colour, and allow me to easily find the correct colour.<br><br>Afterwards, I created some simple layer styles to enhance the appearance of the text. By repeatedly duplicating and then carefully erasing with a <a href="#3.2">pencil-mode eraser</a>, I was able to create a 3D text effect, which I detailed with more layer styles. I used drop shadows, inner shadows and inner strokes. I also added a clipped layer above the two faces of the cuboid to add a highlight up the sides and back of the top half, and a slight shadow along the bottom of the other half. The highlight line in the centre was created with layer styles.

	In order to further develop the 3D text, I added more layer effects and added pixelated gradients over different parts of text. This was to create an illusion that the surface of the text was concaved. I used the brush tool to create a softer shadow below the text on the bottom half of the dark-grey block. Using clipping masks, I also added shading and highlighting to the extruded aprts of the lettering.<br><br>I then used the pencil tool to create cracks in the text and the base block. I used a soft brush to create patches of darker material around these cracks, and then also added a cracked hole in the block. I used more layer styles to create a highlight below the cracks, and therefore giving them the subtle appearance of being 3D and set into the text and cuboid. I could have also used the *Bevel and Emboss* effect in the Photoshop layer styles to create this effect.

	After having created the cracks, I used the pencil tool again with the specified green colour to draw the drips of acid being released from the subject of the image. As all of the drips were on the same layer, I added layer styles to made the acid appear more three-dimensional. I added an inner shadow to the top of the drips, which I made white and set to the overlay blending mode. This made the tops of the drips a brighter green colour, which appears as a reflection. I made sure that the majority of the liquid was still of the correct colour (RGB [170,255,0]), and placed the layer above all of the others so that the colour would not be affected by any adjustment layers I created, something I did in the following step<br><br>The last step of designing the logo was the colour correction that I added. I used adjustment layers to alter the brightness, saturation and contrast of the logo, using a mask so that the adjustments would not affect the temporary background I was using. I used a soft, white brush &ndash; particularly around the "UFO" text &ndash; to highlight certain areas of the logo. I also added simple, filled layers which I set to the *Screen* blending mode, giving the logo a blue haze at the bottom, a warmer orange tint towards the top, and a generally more washed out appearance. Although often considered a negative attribute of an image, I think the lightened shadows improve the logo.

# Poster [P3]

I also designed a poster for the fictional game. Below, eight steps of progression I took are shown and explained, and the final poster is shown.

	The poster started with a blank, portrait, A4 canvas at 300 DPI. I unlocked the white background layer, and inserted it to create a black canvas. I also added some slight lighting in the lower-centre area, where the logo would be positioned. I then copied and pasted the logo from the logo document into the poster, and increased the size of the layer with the free transform feature. I made sure to use "nearest neighbour" resampling, giving the logo a retro pixel-art style. This also meant that the logo &ndash; which was only created at 320 &times; 240 pixels &ndash; would not lose quality in an ugly way.

# Responding to Feedback [P5]

In order to gauge the success of the two images I created, I asked other members of my class to fill out a small form about the poster and logo. I took their feedback and recommendations into consideration and changed the two images. The final versions and a short summary of the changes I made to each are shown below.
