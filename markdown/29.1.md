# Prompts to Upgrade [P1]

There are a number of reasons IT administrators of an enterprise or educational establishment network may decide to upgrade the software running on the network's computers and servers. The events that lead to the upgrading of a particular software package across a network are referred to as prompts, and can generally be categorised as either internal or external.

## Internal

Problems found in the operation of the software could prompt and upgrade. If a bug was found to be troubling staff or students using a program, the IT administrators would likely check for a new version periodically until the issue was fixed. If the software was developed on an open-source model and was made available on one of many source-code hosting websites, the staff could also report the bug to the developers to ensure they were aware of the flaw.

A warning generated by a program may push the administrative staff to upgrade its software package. This could be shown in the log files that the program was responsible for writing, or as a graphical warning in the actual program. As an example, many will remember pop-ups from the taskbar asking to update Adobe Flash Player of Java browser plugin. These programs have become notoriously persistent, and they have reason to be. Both of these pieces of software add web-based content players to browsers running on the system, meaning that websites are able to execute software directly on the computer. A security vulnerability being discovered in either of these software packages, which are installed on a huge number of computers around the world, could have a drastic effect. A flaw in the software could put any user at risk of identity theft, computer infection or reduced performance, among others.

Changes to the policy or aim of an organisation could also cause software updates to be carried out. If a company is found to be taking insufficient security measures and makes a public promise to improve their practices, existing security software may be updated and additional packages installed.

A member of staff or a member of faculty could also alert the administrative IT support in the organisation to a newer version of particular piece of software. This could be a staff member in the art department of an educational institution asking for newer versions of design software to be installed on the computers used for the subject. They may also ask the IT staff to upgrade the hardware drivers on the systems if students were having issues with such. In the case of a company, a team of workers may desire to start offering a new service to customers, and require additional software to do this. Already-installed software may well be upgraded in the same process.

Newer hardware being brought into an organisation is a common prompt for large-scale software updates. Many organisations will take the opportunity to upgrade the entire operating system if a newer release has been made available, and applications updates often follow. New drivers will often be required with new hardware installations, and these must be installed for full-functionality.

Those responsible for the logistics of upgrading the software may be the prompt themselves. They may periodically check for newer versions of installed software out of habit, and continually update the systems used in the organisation.

## External

An article online read by one of the administrative staff in charge of software upgrading may prompt them to download the latest version of a package. Similarly, a discussion thread on an IT-related Facebook page or reddit community could make a technician aware of new features, security patches and bug fixes brought by a new version. Particularly in the case of security patching, new versions of software packages are generally archived and made available online within hours of source-code being released. Running a single command on all the organisation's computers could cause them to refresh their cached list of packages and to install the latest available updates. As an example, a huge number of computers and servers had to be updated immediately when the *Heartbleed* bug was discovered in the popular encryption library OpenSSL. This software is responsible for a great amount of encryption and cryptography which secures email services; connections between browsers and web servers; and information published by whistle blowers. The *Heartbleed* bug in OpenSSL, similarly to the *Shellshock* bug discovered in the `bash` shell, was quickly patched. As almost any system open to the web and running these software packages was at risk, system administrators around the world updated as soon as possible.

An email distributed by the software package's developer could also prompt the IT staff in an organisation to update. Advertising the new features and improvements made to the software since the last version could persuade the staff to upgrade. Developers of software often operate newsletter and mailing list services, which would enable them to quickly make their customer base aware of new versions.

# Importance of User Acceptance [P6]

When a computer system, particularly an element of software, is upgraded to a newer version it's important for the technician(s) responsible for the upgrade to ensure user satisfaction. Particularly when working as a third party and temporarily serving different businesses, one should seek written confirmation that the work carried out meets the employers specification. For example, the updated software needs to successfully carry out the tasks it would normally, and the end users of the software must be un-hindered when working. When the company whose software is in question is paying for the upgrade service, they must also feel that they have been given their money's worth. If a signed document confirming these things is not acquired by the person responsible for the upgrade, they may find themselves faced with demands for further unpaid work or even responsibility for damages.

When upgrading, it's important to ensure that existing work and infrastructure 

## User Interface and Experience

UI and UX are notorious for changing between different version of a software package, and there are several ways that the transition to a newer interface can be eased. By giving the users of the application within an organisation a presentation about the new features available to them, the uses of those features, and the changes to existing elements of a program, the process of upgrading can be made a lot smoother. Employees often find that the programs and program functionality they are used to using change with updates, and their productivity is impacted.

## Handover

After the users of the application have been informed of the changes to the software they use in their work, a sign-off or handover process is typically undertaken. This involves a legal document being signed that confirms the upgrade has been successfully and satisfactorily completed, and that the customer is content with the service. This document means that after the upgrade has been completed, the customers and users are not able to legally challenge the agency or employee responsible for carrying it out. If the users experience difficulty using the new software, lose data or cause other damages and loss, the customers are to blame. This is effectively insurance for the agency or employee, protecting them against unfair business.

## Licensing and Contracts

Upgrading certain software packages is not as simple as just downloading and installing the new version. In certain cases, one must seek official licensing to use the software when there is a newer version released. Some software, such as the popular text editor Sublime Text, only requires one license, which can be used with all version 2 and 3 builds of the program. In contrast, Adobe Photoshop upgrades come with a fee. The price of an upgraded version would once be around &pound;150 if a previous version was owned, whereas a completely new license would cost closer to &pound;800. This upgrade model changed with the introduction of Adobe's subscription-based service, Creative Cloud.

# Precaution When Upgrading [P2] [D2]

When software upgrades are performed within a large organisation, there are a number of risks that need to be considered by those responsible for the upgrade. Many of these risks can be avoided with planning; affected members of staff could be asked how badly their workflow would be impacted by certain risks becoming reality, and the upgrade schedule modelled on this.

## Risks of Software Upgrades

### Loss of Service

The potential &ndash; likely, even &ndash; loss of services while an upgrade is in progress is a common reason to be apprehensive in the face of a system update. As many businesses use servers to centralise operations such as user authentication and file storage, updates to the software packages allowing this to happen can cause downtime, which can have a negative affect on those trying to work. Very often the operating systems running on the client computers will need to be restarted after an upgrade to important software, despite the fact that it has been shown to be possible for software to update seamlessly without a system reboot when built correctly. An operating system upgrade in particular can put the employees' machines out of order for a significant amount of time. If updates are performed on the server, this may need restarting to fully enable new features, and will bring further downtime as a result.

The effects of the server being offline may well be felt outside of the organisation as well as inside. If the server hosts not just internal services such as authentication and network sharing but external services such as a web site or public API, these may be forced offline too. Although it is generally not advised to have internal and external services executing on the same physical machine, a small scale business may not be able to afford more hardware. The software operating the external services may also be the software that requires and update, in which case load may be temporarily shifted to another system or the downtime scheduled, announced, and kept to minimum.

### Incompatibility Issues

When upgrading software packages, it is important in many cases that the new version still supports the applications built by an organisation using an earlier release. For example, a Python script written for Python version 3.2 should work exactly as intended when executed with a Python 3.3 runtime. If the script was written for Python 2.7, however, it will likely not. This is because of very significant changes to syntax between the two versions. In order not to drop all support for developers still using programs written in Python 2.7 syntax, the old version is still maintained and provides some of the new features and particularly security fixes added to Python 3.3 by way of backports.

In the case of a typical office business, this may relate more to file formats and desktop applications. By default, Microsoft Word 2007 and onwards save word documents in the `.docx` format, rather than the `.doc` format used in Word 2003 and before. In order to retain backwards compatibility, Microsoft made it possible to save work in either format. The newer versions of the program are also able to open legacy-formatted files, and plugins have been created for 2003 and earlier to enable `.docx` editing. The `.docx` format was designed to allow future versions of Word to save more information more efficiently and enable more features in the program.
