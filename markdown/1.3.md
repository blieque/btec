When developing software, it's important to understand the different forms of programming languages, and the way in which instructions make their way down to CPU-level. There are many different programming languages and methods by which human-readable source code that developers typically write is converted to basic instructions a computer can perform. These methods, and techniques teams of developers use to make the creation of software easier, are explored below. 

## Machine Code

At the lowest level of programming is machine code. This is held in binary files, rather than text files that can easily be read by a variety of programs, and is most commonly created using a piece of software called a compiler. Machine code is very impractical to write directly, and for this reason, it very rarely is. Because machine code consists of instructions for the CPU, it can only be executed on CPUs of a particular architecture. For example, machine code written or compiled for an ARM chip &ndash; often found in smartphones and other hand-held devices &ndash; cannot run on a desktop x86-64 processor. The most common architectures in use today are x86 (desktop 32-bit), x86-64 (desktop 64-bit), ARM (mobile 32-bit) and recently ARMv8-A (mobile 64-bit). Many believe that within around five years, 32-bit chips will have become a rarity, due to the limitations imposed on developers that must support them.

The highest-level programming languages often fit into the interpreted category. These languages are not compiled to any degree, and include a lot of scripting languages. In order to be executed, they depend on an interpreter being available, which reads the script, identifies tasks to be completed, and executes them. An interpreter could be written in a compiled language (which is preferable and most likely), a semi-compiled language or even another interpreted language.

Common examples of interpreted languages include Ruby, Python, JavaScript, ActionScript and Perl. That said, JavaScript is compiled before execution by engines such as V8 (used in Google Chrome and by node.js), and projects and tools exist or have been started that aim to compile Python and Ruby scripts to improve performance and remove dependency on the language being installed on the host computer.

#### Markup Languages

There are a handful of languages often mistaken for programming languages, which are in fact markup or key-value data storage formats. Popular examples of these languages include HTML, XML, YML, JSON and CSS. The distinguishing attribute of a markup language versus a programming language is that the former is not executed like the latter. No interpreter, VM or compiler reads the file from top to bottom, converting instructions it encounters to machine code. Instead, an parser picks pieces of information out of the file, and builds a data model from it. In the case of SGML-based languages &ndash; particularly HTML &ndash; this is in the form of a document tree, containing element nodes and text nodes. In the case of XML, YML and JSON, the result is a data object containing the date represented in the markup format. In the case of CSS, the result is styling applied to elements of another markup format's elements, most commonly those of an HTML or SVG document.

In key and value pair formats, such as JSON, the value of a variable can often one of many formats. Common variable data types found in most programming languages are usually available, including integers, strings and arrays. The majority of formats also allow dictionaries, which are arrays of information with string identifiers, essentially what a key-value pair data storage format is.
