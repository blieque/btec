# Legal Implications of Design [P6]

When creating the logo as part of the [second assignment](/btec/30.2) in the Digital Graphics unit, I used three images soruced from the internet:

| Image | Source | Description | License
|-|-|-|-|
| <img src="/btec/img/30.3.1.jpg"> | <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=57723">visibleearth.nasa.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.freehdbackgrounds.net/earth-space-wallpapers.htm">www.freehdbackgrounds.net</a> |  One of the most iconic photographs of Earth, the famed Blue Marble image is property of NASA's. It can be found on the NASA website, as well as other such as the linked wallpaper website. NASA allows for use of its intellectual property for educational purposes, as well as others, which I would classify the poster as. Were the game not fictional, I would seek direct permission from NASA for the image's use, or find a royalty free alternative. | NASA's Earth Observatory, education purposes |
