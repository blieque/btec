# Legal Implications of Design [P6]

There are a number of legal implications one must consider when creating digital graphics and particularly when using images and graphics created by other people. Initiatives such as the Creative Commons

When creating the poster as part of the [second assignment](/btec/30.2) in the Digital Graphics unit, I used three images sourced from the internet:

Image | Source | Description | License
-|-|-|-|
<img src="/btec/img/30.3.1.jpg"> | [visibleearth.nasa.gov](http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=57723), [www.freehdbackgrounds.net](http://www.freehdbackgrounds.net/earth-space-wallpapers.htm) |  One of the most iconic photographs of Earth, the famed Blue Marble image is property of NASA's. It can be found on the NASA website, as well as other such as the linked wallpaper website. NASA allows for use of its intellectual property for educational purposes, as well as others, which I would classify the poster as. Were the game not fictional, I would seek direct permission from NASA for the image's use, or find a royalty free alternative. | NASA's Earth Observatory, education purposes
<img src="/btec/img/30.3.2.jpg"> | [www.spacetelescope.org](http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0711a/) | An image taken by the Hubble telescope and published on the ESA website. The image shows clusters of stars in the NGC 4449 galaxy. The image is accompanied by the ESA's image license, linked in the next table cell. The image is used fairly with credit given to the the ESA and Space Telescope website. | Creative Commons-based license, described [here](http://www.spacetelescope.org/copyright/).
<img src="/btec/img/30.3.3.jpg"> | [www.scifi-meshes.com](http://www.scifi-meshes.com/forums/showthread.php?78004-Stargate-Redemotion-USS-Icarus-Ver-III), [space.desktopnexus.com](http://space.desktopnexus.com/wallpaper/1689517/) | The image is a work-in-progress render of the starship Icarus, created as part of a fan-driven project to create a shot film based in the Stargate universe. The model and render were created by user [-=sAs=-](http://www.scifi-meshes.com/forums/member.php?5280-sAs) on the Sci-Fi Meshes forum.
