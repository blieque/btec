## Backing-Up the Window Registry

Windows uses the *registry* to store key-value pairs for a great amount of uses. Changes made to a Windows system's configuration are kept in the registry, which can also be edited manually with the Registry Editor, or `regedit.exe`. Microsoft encourages developers of software for Windows to use the registry to store information about configuration as well, which can lead to problems. When an installer program has access to administrative permissions and the registry, the potential to intentionally cause damage is real.
