# Planing Stage [P3]

## Installation

* **Software for new install:** LibreOffice suite

Stage | Notes | Completed
-|-|:-:
Prerequisites | Before the installation process begins I will check that the computer has a working connection to the internet. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Communication with other parties | In a real scenario, I would double-check that those who had requested the installation were certain of their decision. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
User privileges | In order perform the installation I will root user privileges, most easily obtained using the `sudo` program. I will therefore need access to an account trusted by `sudo`; likely an administration account. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Guidance for colleagues | The new software will appear in the menu alongside the other installed software. Each program will be available under its respective category, which is most commonly "office". Licence information regarding LibreOffice can be read online (<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/licenses/">www.libreoffice.org</a>). | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Installation documentation | I will look online at the LibreOffice Git repository for an installation README, as well as the Launchpad project page for any recently discovered issues. I will make license information available to users. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Loading facilities | The software installation will be downloaded during the process of installation. Using a package repository mirror on the network server, the packages will not need to be downloaded from the internet for each client, but rather just copied from another device on the network. Package repository mirrors can be easily set up, and clients can easily be configured to use one. As the data is originating from a server, the speed will depend on how quickly the server can load the data itself, although this could be very quick with the use of RAM disc. | <input type="checkbox" checked>

## Upgrade

* **Software for upgrade:** VLC Media Player

Stage | Notes | Completed
-|-|:-:
Prerequisites | The updating process will require a working internet connection as well. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Communication with other parties | I would not seek confirmation before upgrading as I would when installing new software as I would not expect any objection from employees. Also, unless objection was widespread and opinions could not be changed, I would still go ahead. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
User privileges | The upgrade process requires the same permissions as the installation process, detailed above. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Guidance for colleagues | The software in question, VLC media player, and any other packages which are out of date will now be upgraded to the latest stable release version. This process should be seamless, and the new software should be available very soon. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Installation documentation | I would look online at the Ubuntu package database to check that no obvious errors had cropped up. The likelihood of such an event is low, and faulty versions of a software package would not be made available to the public. | <input type="checkbox" checked>
Loading facilities | As with the new installation of LibreOffice, the VLC media player upgrade would only require fetching the update from a local server. See the installation plan table for more information. | <input type="checkbox" checked>

# Installation Report [P4]

<!-- ## Windows -->

<!-- ## Linux -->

Below are images showing the key stages of the installation process, with Ubuntu Linux used to demonstrate. The process would be same using Debian Linux, as the former is based on the latter, and the two use the same package management program.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.1.1.png">
	One can run <code>apt-cache search libreoffice</code> to list packages with "libreoffice" in their name or short description. This is very rarely necessary when finding a package.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.1.2.png">
	As LibreOffice was already installed, I decided to demonstrate the installation with AwesomeWM, a popular tiling window manager. The package is installed by running <code>apt-get install awesome</code>, and LibreOffice would be installed with <code>apt-get install libreoffice</code>.

# Upgrade Report [P5]

<!-- ## Windows -->

<!-- ## Linux -->

Below are images showing the key stages of the software upgrade process. Ubuntu Linux is once again used.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.2.1.png">
	When upgrading, one must first refresh the local APT package database with <code>apt-get update</code>. This makes the computer aware of new package releases and changes to package metadata.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.2.2.png">
	Once the database is updated, one can simply run <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> to upgrade all packages to their latest versions. The "dist-" part of the command means that the upgrade process may upgrade the entire OS to a newer version. In rolling release distributions (<em>distros</em>) such as Arch Linux, all packages being up-to-date means the entire OS is up-to-date; there are no separated releases as there are with Debian Linux or OS X.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.2.3.png">
	If no updates are available for download, <code>apt-get</code> will exit after showing information about the packages installed. For example, packages that were installed automatically but are no longer depended upon by any other packages will be listed, and can be removed with the <code>autoremove</code> option.

# Requirements in Preparation [M2]

When installing a new package of software in Linux, and particularly across a network of computers, a few steps must be undertaken before the process can commence. In the case of a business which operates a number of employee terminals around an office, the local server mirror of the package repository will need to updated, or created if it does not exist. Using a local mirror will greatly improve the time that the process takes, will hugely reduce the stress placed on the business' internet connection, and will place less stress on the official, public package repositories. The updating process should not be more complex than running a handful of commands once the mirror has been created, which will instruct the server to download compressed archives for the latest versions of specified packages. In this case this will be the `libreoffice` meta-package and all of its dependencies.

My suggestion would be to perform the upgrade after work has finished and employees are no longer using their terminals, and on a Wednesday or Thursday. This way the computers are not in use and can easily be worked on, and the employees are still given some time during the week to become acquainted with the new software. If the installation was performed before the weekend, employees may spend longer learning to use the new software, and more time is at risk if the upgrade is performed at the beginning of the week.

Users and management should be informed of the changes, and be prepared for potential issues that may arise, however unlikely. If users are aware of the new installation, they will be less surprised to find the new software and may even have time to practice with it outside of work. Management should also be aware of the installation so that it has a better understanding of the current events in the business' IT infrastructure.

Before proceeding with the installation, one must be familiar with potential back-out procedures if the installation process does not go accordingly to plan. In the case of Linux, one should be aware of how to remove a particular package and the packages installed alongside it, and then remove any "orphaned" packages that are not required by any other software. Removal of a package and its unneeded dependencies is outlined in the [Backing Out of a Software Upgrade](#6) section.

Before being able to perform and installation, one must be able to acquire root privileges on the machines in question. This is most often achieved using the `sudo` command, short for "substitute user do", which allows one user to easily execute a program as another user. In order to gain root access via `sudo`, however, one needs access to an administration account which is trusted by `sudo`. Once access to an administrator user account has been granted, one is able to also access a root-level command line shell for more complex tasks which require heightened permissions.

# Data Integrity when Upgrading [M3]

When performing an update of software, it's important that user data and configuration is not lost in the process. For this reason, most IT departments in businesses, organisations and institutions choose to make frequent back-ups of huge amounts of data, so that in the event of any slight mishap, everything can be recovered.

## Backing-Up the Window Registry

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.3.png">
	The Registry Editor, commonly known as "reg. edit.", allows the registry to be exported quickly and easily.
	<div>Image by me; see <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>

Windows uses the *registry* to store key-value pairs for a great amount of uses. Changes made to a Windows system's configuration are kept in the registry, which can also be edited manually with the Registry Editor, or `regedit.exe`. Microsoft encourages developers of software for Windows to use the registry to store information about configuration as well, which can lead to problems. When an installer program has access to administrative permissions and the registry, the potential to intentionally cause damage is real.

# Backing Out of a Software Upgrade [M4]

In some situations one may wish to back out of a software upgrade or installation. Before the process begins, one may wish to preserve an exact image of their hard-drive in its working state. In order to do this, separate, empty hard-drives could be formatted and the data from active drives them copied onto them exactly. This clone of the drive could be used to restore everything to its previous state immediately.

## Cloning a Disc Partition

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.4.png">
	GParted, a popular drive partitioning tool for Linux, can be used to create mirrors of disc partitions. These can be copies on the same device, or on another device connected to the machine.
