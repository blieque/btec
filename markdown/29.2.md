# Installation Report [P4]

	One can run <code>apt-cache search libreoffice</code> to list packages with "libreoffice" in their name or short description. This is very rarely necessary when finding a package.

	As LibreOffice was already installed, I decided to demonstrate the installation with AwesomeWM, a popular tiling window manager.

# Upgrade Report [P5]

<!-- ## Linux -->

<div class="i">

	When upgrading, one must first refresh the local APT package database with <code>apt-get update</code>. This makes the computer aware of new package releases and changes to package metadata.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.4.2.png">
	Once the database is updated, one can simply run <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> to upgrade all packages to their latest versions. The "dist-" part of the command means that the upgrade process may upgrade the entire OS to a newer version. In rolling release distributions (<em>distros</em>) such as Arch Linux, all packages being up-to-date means the entire OS is up-to-date; there are no separated releases as there are with Debian Linux or OS X.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/29.2.4.3.png">
	If no updates are available for download, <code>apt-get</code> will exit after showing information about the packages installed. For example, packages that were installed automatically but are no longer depended upon by any other packages will be listed, and can be removed with the <code>autoremove</code> option.

# Requirements in Preparation [M2]

## Installation

## Upgrade

# Data Integrity when Upgrading [M3]

## Backing-Up the Window Registry

Windows uses the *registry* to store key-value pairs for a great amount of uses. Changes made to a Windows system's configuration are kept in the registry, which can also be edited manually with the Registry Editor, or `regedit.exe`. Microsoft encourages developers of software for Windows to use the registry to store information about configuration as well, which can lead to problems. When an installer program has access to administrative permissions and the registry, the potential to intentionally cause damage is real.
