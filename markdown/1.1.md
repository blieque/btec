## Technical Skills and Experience

From the research I conducted regarding employment in the IT industry, I found that most of the job opportunities required a specific skill-set, in order that the employee would be able to fit into the business exactly as required. For many of the businesses, this included a number of languages and development packages, including various flavours of JavaScript, server-side programming languages and Git revision control. It appears that most of the potential employers using internet-based job-finding services are looking for a developer simply with experience in a certain field. I assume that one may find that the placements that fit in this category may last for a shorter period of time. By advertising a placement as requiring particular skills, the employer suggests that there could be a single project for a certain client that requires such expertise. Once this project is complete and the client is content, the knowledge of the developer may not be needed any longer.
