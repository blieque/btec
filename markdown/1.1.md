## Online-Advertised Vacancy Analysis

After looking at the skills required by the employers using [Careers 2.0](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/uk/) to advertise vacancies, I found the following:

### Technical Skills and Experience

I found that most of the job opportunities required a specific skill-set, in order that the employee would be able to fit into the business exactly as required. For many of the businesses, this included a number of languages and development packages, including various flavours of JavaScript, server-side programming languages and Git revision control. It appears that most of the potential employers using internet-based job-finding services are looking for a developer simply with experience in a certain field. I assume that one may find that the placements that fit in this category may last for a shorter period of time. By advertising a placement as requiring particular skills, the employer suggests that there could be a single project for a certain client that requires such expertise. Once this project is complete and the client is content, the knowledge of the developer may not be needed any longer.

### Generic Work Habits

### Personal Qualities

## Kent Employability Research Analysis

The following qualities were found to be the most sought after and valued by employees by recent research conducted by the University of Kent. In order to reach these ten values, the Careers and Employability Service at the university asked representatives of a number of companies The valuable data that they found can be used to draw a number of conclusions about the skills which job seekers should try to develop.

In order to collect the information used to draw conclusions, the university students created a multiple surveys and distributed them to several companies. Representatives of Microsoft, Target Jobs, the BBC, Prospects, NACE and AGR were all asked what they looked for in potential new employees. These companies spanned a variety of businesses, covering information and communications; broadcasting and journalism; and job vacancy and employment services. By gathering information and opinion from employers in varying fields, a wide picture can be built up of the skills required in general. The use of surveys overall also means that the information presented is accurate.

The research was summarised in a table of values that were shown to be most valuable to employers. Verbal communication, team-working and commercial awareness accounted for the top three, showing that knowledge and experience in the particular field of the employer was not as essential as many may believe. Despite this, I personally wonder if more specific values are required by each of the businesses, but due to the spread of the selected companies across different fields of business, these were not common among different employers and therefore did not appear in the list summarising the results.

Each of the top five most desirable employee attributes are listed below:

* **Verbal communication** refers to the ability to talk in front of an audience and deliver points and opinion in this way. As an applicant for a job vacancy, showing that you are able to do this shows that you will be able to work honestly and not hinder the efficiency of the business as a result of being unable to clearly convey information.

* **Teamwork** is also important to business. As someone working in a company, it's almost inevitable that an employee will be required to work as part of a team.

* **Commercial awareness**

* **Analysing & investigating**

* **Initiative and self motivation**

<!-- * **Drive**

* **Written communication**

* **Planning & organising**

* **Flexibility**

* **Time management ** -->
