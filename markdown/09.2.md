# Components of a Network [P3] [D1]

There are a number of different components in a typical enterprise computer network. Although most components are essentially just a computer, they can be categorised based upon their hardware and software capabilities and can be used in a network to serve a particular purpose.

## End Devices

End devices are those used by employees in a business or by other end users. They consists primarily of computers, including both laptops and desktops; servers, used indirectly by likely every client; and other consumer electronics such as smartphones and tablets.

### PCs

A PC must meet a number of requirements in order to connect to a network and then send and receive data to and from other clients on the network.

In terms of hardware, a computer requires a network interface controller, or NIC. This is typically found in the form of a built-in motherboard network chip, PCIe network expansion card or wireless expansion card. A NIC is accompanied by a unique MAC address, which is used to identify the client on a network by switches and cannot be changed in the same way that an IP address can be. In addition to the MAC address given to a client by it's NIC, it is usually assigned an IP address in order for it to communicate across a network. This is configured by software, not hardware, however.

In terms of software, the client requires an operating system with networking drivers that allows for IP addresses to be configured. Popular choices for client operating systems include Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android. Support for DHCP can ease the process of building a network greatly, and this considered standard. IP address assignment can be achieved in one of two ways; static configuration or DHCP allocation. Static IP addresses only change when changed by an administrator, and must be specified on each machine individually. DHCP, or dynamic host configuration protocol, allows for a server to allocate machines an IP address within a certain range. This address can be used until the lease for it expires, which is generally around eight days, but clients should attempt to retrieve a new address when the lease is half-expired. The DHCP server is found by a client by way of a `DHCPDISCOVER` packet broadcast on the network.

### Servers

Server hardware is effectively the same from a networking standpoint, although servers are often equipped with high-speed network interface devices. An example of this would be the inclusion of a fibre networking card to make the connection to switches, routers and other servers faster. A server may also include more than one interface to allow for redundancy or connection to multiple networks.

Servers require an operating system in the same way that clients do, although different software choices are generally made on the server-side. For example, OS X Server is available from Apple, although it sees minimal usage. Linux distributions such as CentOS, RHEL and Debian largely dominate the server market, with many businesses opting to use Windows servers for email and Office applications.

## Interconnection Devices [P4]

In order to allow multiple client devices to connect in a single network, and to allow several networks to communicate, interconnection devices are used. These account for most nodes within a network, when excluding clients and servers.

### Switches

In order for a group of more than two computers to all be able to communicate with one another, a switch is required. All of the devices are connected to the switch either by wire or wirelessly with a [WAP](#1.2.3), and send information to the switch. The switch then analyses the packets of data sent to it and retrieves the MAC address of the destination. Using a table of physical ports and MAC addresses, the switch then forwards the package to the correct client.

#### Hubs

Before switches were developed, a similar device called a hub was used. These are not as advanced as switches in that they do not target the information they transmit.

### Routers

* Access control
* DHCP
* Broadcasts
* NAT
* QoS

### WAP

## Inter-Device Connection

### Wireless

* WLAN
	* 802.11x
	* WEP, WPA, WPA2

### Wired

#### Ethernet

* UTP -> Copper
* "RJ45", 8P8C
* Cat 5/5e/5(x)/6
* Cheap, slowish

#### Fibre

* Coax.
* Delicate -> splicing
* Pricey but well speedy

# Network Design [M2]

In order to demonstrate the use of network components without requiring real hardware, I used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a network. The brief given required a number of devices to be connected in a network, and the network needed to meet certain criteria. A download link to the Packet Tracer file and screenshots of the network are provided below.
