# Components of a Network [P3] [D1]

There are a number of different components in a typical enterprise computer network. Although most components are essentially just a computer, they can be categorised based upon their hardware and software capabilities and can be used in a network to serve a particular purpose.

## End Devices

End devices are those used by employees in a business or by other end users. They consists primarily of computers, including both laptops and desktops; servers, used indirectly by likely every client; and other consumer electronics such as smartphones and tablets.

### PCs

A PC must meet a number of requirements in order to connect to a network and then send and receive data to and from other clients on the network.

In terms of hardware, a computer requires a network interface controller, or NIC. This is typically found in the form of a built-in motherboard network chip, PCIe network expansion card or wireless expansion card. A NIC is accompanied by a unique MAC address, which is used to identfy the 

* NICs -> MAC addresses, NAT, encapsulation
* OS -> Config.

### Servers

* OS

## Interconnection Devices [P4]

### Switches

#### Hubs

### Routers

* Access control
* DHCP
* Broadcasts
* NAT
* QoS

## Inter-Device Connection

### Wireless

* WLAN
	* 802.11x
	* WEP, WPA, WPA2

### Wired

#### Ethernet

* UTP -> Copper
* "RJ45", 8P8C
* Cat 5/5e/5(x)/6
* Cheap, slowish

#### Fibre

* Coax.
* Delicate -> splicing
* Pricey but well speedy

# Network Design [M2]

In order to demonstrate the use of network components without requiring real hardware, I used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a network. The brief given required a number of devices to be connected in a network, and the network needed to meet certain criteria. A download link to the Packet Tracer file and screenshots of the network are provided below.
