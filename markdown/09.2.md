# Components of a Network [P3] [D1]

There are a number of different components in a typical enterprise computer network. Although most components are essentially just a computer, they can be categorised based upon their hardware and software capabilities and can be used in a network to serve a particular purpose.

## End Devices

End devices are those used by employees in a business or by other end users. They consists primarily of computers, including both laptops and desktops; servers, used indirectly by likely every client; and other consumer electronics such as smartphones and tablets.

### PCs

A PC must meet a number of requirements in order to connect to a network and then send and receive data to and from other clients on the network.

In terms of hardware, a computer requires a network interface controller, or NIC. This is typically found in the form of a built-in motherboard network chip, PCIe network expansion card or wireless expansion card. A NIC is accompanied by a unique MAC address, which is used to identify the client on a network by switches and cannot be changed in the same way that an IP address can be. In addition to the MAC address given to a client by it's NIC, it is usually assigned an IP address in order for it to communicate across a network. This is configured by software, not hardware, however.

In terms of software, the client requires an operating system with networking drivers that allows for IP addresses to be configured. Popular choices for client operating systems include Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android. Support for DHCP can ease the process of building a network greatly, and this considered standard. IP address assignment can be achieved in one of two ways; static configuration or DHCP allocation. Static IP addresses only change when changed by an administrator, and must be specified on each machine individually. DHCP, or dynamic host configuration protocol, allows for a server to allocate machines an IP address within a certain range. This address can be used until the lease for it expires, which is generally around eight days, but clients should attempt to retrieve a new address when the lease is half-expired. The DHCP server is found by a client by way of a `DHCPDISCOVER` packet broadcast on the network.

### Servers

Server hardware is effectively the same from a networking standpoint, although servers are often equipped with high-speed network interface devices. An example of this would be the inclusion of a fibre networking card to make the connection to switches, routers and other servers faster. A server may also include more than one interface to allow for redundancy or connection to multiple networks.

Servers require an operating system in the same way that clients do, although different software choices are generally made on the server-side. For example, OS X Server is available from Apple, although it sees minimal usage. Linux distributions such as CentOS, RHEL and Debian largely dominate the server market, with many businesses opting to use Windows servers for email and Office applications.

## Interconnection Devices [P4]

In order to allow multiple client devices to connect in a single network, and to allow several networks to communicate, interconnection devices are used. These account for most nodes within a network, when excluding clients and servers.

### Switches

In order for a group of more than two computers to all be able to communicate with one another, a switch is required. All of the devices are connected to the switch either by wire or wirelessly with a [WAP](#1.2.3), and send information to the switch. The switch then analyses the packets of data sent to it and retrieves the MAC address of the destination. Using a table of physical ports and MAC addresses, the switch then forwards the package to the correct client.

In my network I will use switches to connect multiple devices. The reasoning behind this is outlined below; the alternative, a hub, is outdated and has several disadvantages.

#### Hubs

Before switches were developed, a similar device called a hub was used. These are not as advanced as switches in that they do not target the information they transmit. When a packet is received from a connected device, the hub will place it in memory and then send a copy to every other device on the network. This means the the intended recipient will receive the packet, by un-intended recipients may too, making the use of encryption more desirable. It's worth noting that a switch, when experiencing high amounts of traffic, may revert to hub-like behaviour and start forwarding every packet to every client.

In addition to this, devices connected to a hub are in a single collision domain. This means that packet collisions are possible when multiple devices send data to the hub simultaneously. A switch keeps each device in a single collision domain, meaning that packet collisions when several devices transmit at once are theoretically impossible.

Hubs also only support half-duplex data transmission. This means that data may only travel in one direction along the cable at any one time. Full-duplex transmission, which uses the same cabling hardware, supports simultaneous movement of data in both directions. This is more efficient and allows for transfer of large files, for example, in both directions at once.

### Routers

In a similar way that a switch connects multiple end-devices together to form a LAN, routers are used to connect multiple LANs together as a WAN. A router is generally added to a network using a switch in the same way that an end device is, and is then connected to other routers. There are a number of tasks that are, or at least can be, undertaken by a router, other than the connection to other LANs:

* **NAT**, or network address translation, means that routers wrap packets travelling from the LAN out into the WAN in another packet layer, also giving it an IP address to use on the WAN. When packets are sent back to a device on the LAN, the router unwraps the packet again and forwards it to the original client.

* **Broadcasts** are LAN-wide transmissions of data. If data is sent to the network's broadcast address, which can be found accurately by a client given the subnet mask, the switch will send the packet(s) to every connected device; one could image that a switch assumes hub-like behaviour. The package is read by every connected device, and certain services &ndash; including DHCP, explained below &ndash; may respond accordingly.

* **Access control** refers to the selective allowance of traffic through a router. For example, a router can be programmed to not allow certain devices to access the internet, forward traffic from some devices to a different server, and to block traffic to prohibited destinations. The time of day could also potentially be used to restrict access at certain times.

* **DHCP**, or the dynamic host allocation protocol, allows clients to request an IP address to use on the LAN. This negates the need to manually configure the IP addresses on each device of a network. When a device first connects to a network, it will transmit a packet to a MAC broadcast address, which will ideally be replied to by a DHCP server. The response will include an IP address, lease time, and other DHCP data. DHCP is also mentioned in the [PCs](#1.1.1) section.

* **QoS** refers to the selective treatment of network traffic with intention of improving *quality of service*. An example of this is the prioritisation of VoIP call traffic to other networks over standard HTTP traffic. A second delay in a phone call could have a great impact on the effectiveness of the communication and could made the connection unusable. A second more of delay when loading a web-page or downloading a file would have a very minimal effect on productivity and would most likely go unnoticed. QoS is also used in some network cards marketed towards the computer gaming community. These network cards prioritise traffic to online game servers over other traffic, minimising the latency felt in-game.

I will use routers in my network to break the infrastructure up into more manageable sections. By separating the floor

* Delicate -> splicing
* Pricey but well speedy

# Network Design [M2]

In order to demonstrate the use of network components without requiring real hardware, I used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a network. The brief given required a number of devices to be connected in a network, and the network needed to meet certain criteria. A download link to the Packet Tracer file and screenshots of the network are provided below.
