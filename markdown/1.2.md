## Components and Process

### Creation of an Idea

Communication begins with a concept in someone's mind, that they wish to relay to another person. This could be a fact, statement, question or other form of data, but importantly it is not encoded into a format that another could understand, such as written English.

### Encoding

The concept is encoded by the sender, comprising the conversion of the concept in the persons mind into a format that can be decoded by another person. In conversation, when people are having difficulty finding the right word for a particular sentence, this is essentially a bottleneck in the encoding process. In order to encode a message, the sender must be familiar with a medium of communication, which is explained further in the [transmission and noise section](#1.1.4).

### Sending

Once the content of the transmission is encoded, it is sent. In terms of spoken communication, this is in the form of sound generated by a person. In written communication, it may take form digitally or on paper. After this step, the message is no longer in the hands of either party, but rather in the space between the two.

### Transmission and Noise

* Media

This process generates content in the form of spoken German or written Mandarin, which can be sent to another party.

### Receiving

### Decoding

### Understanding

### Feedback

# Barriers to Communication [P3]

There are many different ways in which communication can be impaired. The factors which affect the clarity of a signal are collectively referred to as noise. These factors, when considering written communication, can typically be divided into two categories, described below.

## Visibility Issues

Visibility issues typically involve the communication being less successful due to the signal being aesthetically unclear to begin with. This might be caused by text being written in white over a yellow background, leading to little contrast in brightness between the two colours. In relation to the web, this can be addressed by changing the colours of text, the layout of the page, the size of different sections of text, text decoration, and the typefaces used. For example, text on a website should be clearly visible compared to it background, be well spaced from box borders, large enough to comfortably read, potentially underlined (if a link, for example), and set in clear typography. When the medium that the content is displayed on is a screen, serif fonts like Georgia and Palatino should be avoided, as they can become unclear at small sizes and lighter weighting. Instead, clear sans-serif typefaces should be used, such as Helvetica Neue or Segoe UI.

## Comprehensibility Issues

However clear a piece of text may be in terms of colour and layout, however, written communication can be still be impaired in other ways. If the text uses jargon and over complicated sentence structure, or alternatively uses colloquial terms and over-simplified or incorrect sentence structure, the text can be hard to understand just as much. This can be a problem if developers are forced to write the type for a website, in which case they may use technical terms when referring to the website which have little to no relevance to the average user. The key to making a website or publication that doesn't fall victim to this issue is to clearly understand the demographic that it targets, and to ensure that only relevant information is ever mentioned. An example of type that targets a wide audience and must be easily understood is that shown in newspapers and on digital news distribution platforms. The content is written to be understood by a reading age of lower than the average of the actual readers, meaning that a very small number of readers should experience difficulty.

In terms of spoken communication, it's stereotypical that software developers over-complicate descriptions of technological concepts and terminology when asked to explain them, which can leave people confused and no closer to understanding what they set out to. For the blind in particular, software exists for browsers that reads the content of websites to the user. By changing the way in which a website is programmed, the content that is read out can be altered, and properly tailored to visitors. Similar systems exist that convert text to Braille. In order for a website to be accessible and to achieve its purpose for all users, it should be built and tested to work with software for the disabled.

# Reducing Barriers [M1]

## Visibility Solutions

It's well respected for websites that are targeting a wide demographic, such as internet banking dashboards, to allow the user to change the size and contrast setting for the page. One example of a website which allows this is the [Lloyds Bank website](http://www.lloydsbank.com/). The changing of font sizes and colour schemes can be handled by JavaScript and made persistent when loading new pages with the use of HTML5 `localstorage` or cookies.

## Comprehensibility Solutions

In order to make content accessible and easily comprehended by a wide audience, the following steps can be taken:

* **Subheadings** can be used to break up large sections of text. As well as allowing the reader to take a small break in between passages of text, the headings allow them to find particular parts of the text if they happen to know what their looking for. Having a contents page or index that corresponds to this set of headings can further improve their effectiveness, and numbering the headings well can make navigation of the work easier.

* **Graphics and diagrams** can be used to break up content as well. Not only do they narrow the text column meaning that the type is spread over a larger amount of space, but the images give the reader something else to look at and consider. This break from the text can be refreshing, and for readers who show a more visual learning style, it can explain the subject of the text more clearly.
