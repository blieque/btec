### An Idea

Communication begins with a concept in someone's mind, that they wish to relay to another person. This could be a fact, statement, question or other form of data, but importantly it is not encoded into a format that another could understand, such as written English.

### Encoding

The concept is encoded by the sender, comprising the conversion of the concept in the persons mind into a format that can be decoded by another person. In conversation, when people are having difficulty finding the right word for a particular sentence, this is essentially a bottleneck in the encoding process. In order to encode a message, the sender must be familiar with a medium of communication, which is explained further in the [transmission and noise section](#1.1.4).

### Sending

Once the content of the transmission is encoded, it is sent. In terms of spoken communication, this is in the form of sound generated by a person. In written communication, it may take form digitally or on paper. After this step, the message is no longer in the hands of either party, but rather in the space between the two.

### Transmission and Noise

* Media

This process generates content in the form of spoken German or written Mandarin, which can be sent to another party.

### Receiving

### Decoding

### Understanding

### Feedback

# Barriers to Communication [P3]

Noise can appear in many different forms. Anything that prevents communication from being as successful as it otherwise would be is classed as noise, regardless of whether is literally unwanted sound or not. Noise hinders both interpersonal, or "face-to-face", communication and written communication. Noise which affects the former can be classed within one of two categories; intrinsic or extrinsic. These subcategories are explained [below](#2.1). Similarly, noise that affects written communication can be divided into either the visibility or comprehensibility category, explained [here](#2.2).

## Interpersonal Communication

### Intrinsic Issues

Noise which is caused by the parties involved in the communication is known as intrinsic, or confusingly interpersonal, noise. Some common scenarios that show significant intrinsic noise are explained below.

The parties involved in the communication could not be able to understand each other if they were not all fluent in a single language. This could be a particular problem for businesses when negotiating deals oversees, and could lead to misunderstanding between individuals as to the details of the matter.

***Another example: signal strength?***

### Extrinsic Issues

***Introduce ext.***

The room or area that the communication occurs in is filled with the sound of other people communicating verbally and potentially the sound of machinery or other noise generating objects. Applying primarily to verbal communication, this would be a problem as those communicating may not be able to hear each other over the ambient sounds.

The area in which people are trying to communicate to uncomfortably warm or cold. This would lead to the receivers not being attentive, more of their focus being diverted to adjusting their immediate surroundings. ***Expand***

## Written Communication

### Visibility Issues

Visibility issues typically involve the communication being less successful due to the signal being aesthetically unclear to begin with. This might be caused by text being written in white over a yellow background, leading to little contrast in brightness between the two colours. In relation to the web, this can be addressed by changing the colours of text, the layout of the page, the size of different sections of text, text decoration, and the typefaces used.

### Comprehensibility Issues

However clear a piece of text may be in terms of colour and layout, however, written communication can be still be impaired in other ways. If the text uses jargon and over complicated sentence structure, or alternatively uses colloquial terms and over-simplified or incorrect sentence structure, the text can be hard to understand just as much. This can be a problem if developers are forced to write the type for a website, in which case they may use technical terms when referring to the website which have little to no relevance to the average user. The key to making a website or publication that doesn't fall victim to this issue is to clearly understand the demographic that it targets, and to ensure that only relevant information is ever mentioned. An example of type that targets a wide audience and must be easily understood is that shown in newspapers and on digital news distribution platforms. The content is written to be understood by a reading age of lower than the average of the actual readers, meaning that a very small number of readers should experience difficulty.

In terms of spoken communication, it's stereotypical that software developers over-complicate descriptions of technological concepts and terminology when asked to explain them, which can leave people confused and no closer to understanding what they set out to.

# Reducing Barriers [M1]

Communications hindered by noise can lead to misunderstanding between two parties. This could have potentially very severe consequences, meaning that the overcoming or elimination of noise is essential in the workplace. Some of the ways in which the issues I mentioned above can be solved are detailed below. These issues include intrinsic and extrinsic interpersonal factors as well as visibility and comprehensibility factors in written communication.

## Interpersonal Communication

### Intrinsic Solutions

In order to overcome the barrier created by different people not having a common language in which they can communicate, an interpreter (or many) can be employed to translate between languages. In a scenario centred around written communication, particularly over the internet, online translation services such as Google Translate can be used to change a passage of text into another language, but such applications may miss certain cultural differences which may result in offence being caused.

### Extrinsic Solutions

In order to overcome this, the parties involved in the communication could move to another area, or move closer to one another. In particular cases, a microphone and headphone arrangement could be used. In other situations, people could be asked to talk more quietly or stop talking, or machinery could be switched off or changed to a less disrupting setting.

Although in some particular situations (such as outdoors), this may not be a variable of the environment that can be easily changed, but if it can it can have a big impact on the success of communication. In an office or educational institution, for example, fans or heaters could be used to make those listening more comfortable and therefore better listeners.

## Written Communication

### Visibility Solutions

For example, text on a website should be clearly visible compared to it background, be well spaced from box borders, large enough to comfortably read, potentially underlined (if a link, for example), and set in clear typography. When the medium that the content is displayed on is a screen, serif fonts like Georgia and Palatino should be avoided, as they can become unclear at small sizes and lighter weighting. Instead, clear sans-serif typefaces should be used, such as Helvetica Neue or Segoe UI.

It's well respected for websites that are targeting a wide demographic, such as internet banking dashboards, to allow the user to change the size and contrast setting for the page. One example of a website which allows this is the [Lloyds Bank website](http://www.lloydsbank.com/). The changing of font sizes and colour schemes can be handled by JavaScript and made persistent when loading new pages with the use of HTML5 `localstorage` or cookies.

### Comprehensibility Solutions

For the blind in particular, software exists for browsers that reads the content of websites to the user. By changing the way in which a website is programmed, the content that is read out can be altered, and properly tailored to visitors. Similar systems exist that convert text to Braille. In order for a website to be accessible and to achieve its purpose for all users, it should be built and tested to work with software for the disabled.

In order to make content accessible and easily comprehended by a wide audience, the following steps can be taken:

* **Subheadings** can be used to break up large sections of text. As well as allowing the reader to take a small break in between passages of text, the headings allow them to find particular parts of the text if they happen to know what their looking for. Having a contents page or index that corresponds to this set of headings can further improve their effectiveness, and numbering the headings well can make navigation of the work easier.

* **Graphics and diagrams** can be used to break up content as well. Not only do they narrow the text column meaning that the type is spread over a larger amount of space, but the images give the reader something else to look at and consider. This break from the text can be refreshing, and for readers who show a more visual learning style, it can explain the subject of the text more clearly.
