# File Formats [P2]

Digital graphics can be saved in a number of formats. These each have their benefits and drawbacks, and have intended uses and scenarios in which they perform best. Some of the most common raster formats used in digital graphics creation and the processing of photographs are listed below and described.

Format | File Extension | Usage | Description
-|-|-|-
Portable Network Graphics | `.png` | PNGs are best suited to graphics created on the computer, being exported for use on the web or simply for distribution. As the PNG format is lossless, it is particularly useful when saving images comprised mostly of solid areas of colour, such as logos and illustrations. | PNGs are among the most supported formats, rivalled only by JPEGs in modern software. PNGs are categorised as a **lossless** format, meaning that the quality of the image is unaltered when saved. Because of the way in which the data is saved in a PNG, the format is particularly suited to the web. Two key advantages it has over the JPEG format are the lossless saving and the support for alpha transparency. For this reason, PNGs are often used for icon sprites on the web, where SVGs haven't been used.
Joint Photographic Experts Group format | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | The JPEG format is intended for use encoding photographic data. Many cameras save the images they capture in the JPEG format, and JPEG images are also embedded in other photographic formats such as Canon and Nikon RAW files (`.crw` and `.nef` respectively). The JPEG format is not intended for use in encoding graphics created on the computer, such as those which would typically be saved in the PNG format. This is because the format is lossy, has obvious marks of compression, and does not support alpha transparency. | The format was first defined by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 1992, and has been used since. Although the content is compressed, to a degree defined by the user, the format is much better suited for photography than the PNG format, for instance. JPEGs result in a slight loss of quality in imagery, but this is easily negligible when considering the benefit in file size. Using JPEG compression for photos on the web is essential, in order that visitors are only required to download a necessary amount of data.
Bitmap | `.bmp`, `.dib` | Although rarely used any longer, the bitmap format partially created Microsoft is used mostly to encode digital graphics for use in Windows. The data held in a bitmap file can take a number of forms. For example, the data can be compressed, but needn't be, and can assume various different colour depths, making it a flexible format. The format can also be used on the web, but rarely is. | The bitmap format was created in the early 1990s, partly for use in the Windows operating system. Cursor and icon files using the `.cur` and `.ico` extensions use the bitmap format to represent their images. For this reason, BMPs are still used indirectly in a vast number of situations, as PNGs and SVGs are not yet commonplace as application and website icons.
Photoshop Document | `.psd`, `.psb` |  | |
