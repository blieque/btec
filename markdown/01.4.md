# The Belbin Test

In order to analyse the ways in which we each would work best, we took the Belbin Test in class. Designed over a nine-year period by Dr. Meredith Belbin and his colleagues, the test is designed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a person relation to the workplace. By asking several questions about how one would react in given situations and the attitude one find oneself with in the workplace, the test it able to paint a picture of someone and the role they likely play at work. The test collects scores in a variety of fields which it then uses to determine which team role a person fits most, including plant, monitor evaluator, co-ordinator, resource investigator, implementer, completer finisher, team-worked, shaper and specialist. Each of these roles is accompanied by a lengthy description and list of strengths and weaknesses. Many find their Belbin test result to correlate surprisingly well with the image of themselves that they hold. Others find that the test has little merit.

## Origin

The test originated after Dr. Belbin was invited to observe the meetings between successful managers of various departments and teams internationally who happened to attend the Henley Business School's famous ten-week course for becoming a board member. Part of the course entailed working in teams competitively, against others also taking the course. Dr. Belbin and his three chosen accomplices &ndash; mathematician and chess master Bill Hartston, anthropologist Jeanne Fisher, and psychologist Roger Mottram &ndash; observed around two-hundred teams as part of the project, categorising the behaviour and actions of team members. After their time analysing team workers, they decided upon eight, then later nine, different roles that they had found in a business-centric team environment.

## How the Test Works

### Questions

The test taken by the class consisted of seven questions. In each question, the candidate is asked to tick whichever of the statements about themselves that they feel are true given the specified situation. They are then asked to allocate ten points across the statements they have ticked. The score given should reflect how relevant one feels a particular point is to them. For each question, the points allocated must always add up to ten.

Although not made obvious, each statement in each question is tied to a particular team role, and the position of each role's statement is different for each question. For this reason, the test taken in class offered eight statements for each question. This is due to the late addition of the *specialist* role. The points that ones allocates to particular statements determines the score that one receives at the end of the test for each of the roles. Once one has completed the tests, the points allocated to each statement in each question are placed on a table. Each column of the table represents one of the roles, and each row a question. After copying the scores to the table, the sum in the *Total* row indicates one's closeness to each role. Although one could theoretically score 70 in a single area, one is more likely to score 15&ndash;30 in their more relevant roles, and up to 10 in their less-relevant ones. A typical candidate will show particular connection to 1&ndash;3 of the team roles.

### Roles

The nine team roles all have particular qualities. explained below.

* **Shaper** (SH) &mdash; Often taking the roles of leaders and managers, or at least influential members of a team, *Shapers* are known for their motivation, energy and need for achievement. They are often strongly set on their goals, and may allow the feelings of their subordinates to suffer as a side effect of completing objectives. They are important in a team in order to keep the group moving forward and to say the things people may not always want to hear. Unfortunately, they are prone to being easily provoked, irritable and sometimes offensive to others.

* **Co-ordinator** (CO) &mdash; Also useful for managing a team, but with the potential to clash with *Shapers*, *Co-ordinators* are calm and generally well respected members of team. Usually found to be better at organising their equal colleagues as opposed to subordinates, and rarely ruling with an iron fist, *Co-ordinators* are useful in teams with clashing roles and talents. They may not be the most specialised or talented in completing work themselves, but they help to make sure the other members of the team work smoothly together.

* **Plant** (PL) &mdash; Inclined to go against tradition and to have a lot of unconventional and innovative ideas, *Plants* like to work by themselves. They often appear to be introverted, and react when their work is praised or criticised. *Plants* often become the creators of original and new products or services, and may take the role of a founder or potentially the CEO of a company. Despite the use of their often innovative ideas, *Co-ordinators* can forget or disregard the practical constraints and implications of their plans, and may not take well to being made aware of this.

* **Resource Investigator** (RI) &mdash; Providing enthusiasm to a team and encouragement to follow a new path when made available, *Resource Investigators* are often useful to a *Plant*. Not always being the most original or innovative people themselves, they instead find others' ideas and develop them. They are able to make recommendations, and to bring other workers to a project whom they feel would help. Despite their ability to bring life to an idea, they are also liable to lose interest after a period of time once the initial excitement has ended.

* **Monitor Evaluator** (ME) &mdash; Often taking the role of decision makers, *Monitor Evaluators* like to see both sides of an argument and spend time considering them in their head. They may appear to be over-critical and unemotional to other members of a team, but they gain strength from their immunity to sudden excitement. They are level-headed, and like to approach decisions in an organised way, but are generally lacking when it comes to motivating their colleagues.

* **Implementer** (IMP) &mdash; Often successful inn climbing through the levels of a business, *Implementers* are organised and particularly self-disciplined workers. They are able to focus on work that must be competed, as little as they may wish to do so. They have a common sense and practicality that is useful in ensuring a project remains feasible and worthwhile. They are attracted to routine and familiarity, and are hard-working, but may prove to be un-flexible and sceptical of new ideas that lack proof or evaluation.

* **Teamworker** (TW) &mdash; Potentially described as the social glue of a group, *Team Workers* provide support for people in a group, and allow the different members to communicate and work together effectively. They are useful in promoting a good team spirit and motivating the workers, and are able to respond to people's problems. They can be susceptible to stress or pressure, however, and are not often the best decision makers. They may be able to provide support, but this is often related to interpersonal matters, and they are not always efficient as a leader.

* **Completer Finisher** (CF) &mdash; 

* **Specialist** (SP) &mdash;

## Grid

The below grid shows the two goals I have set for myself to complete within three weeks.

Time Scale | Goal
-|-
Long term  | Become a web designer/developer for an agency or myself.
Short term | Finish a website I'm currently building, and potentially build another using technologies I am currently not familiar with.

A more detailed plan of what I set out to achieve is shown below. I felt that setting a list of objectives would help to ensure that I achieve the most I can in the allotted time.

Interim Targets | Actions | Success Criteria | Review Date
-|-|-|-
Familiarise myself with the project, as I haven't had time to work on it for some time. | Read through the source code I've already written, and potentially make some readability improvements. | Being more familiar with the code I previously wrote, in order that I can continue development easily. | 31<sup>st</sup> January
