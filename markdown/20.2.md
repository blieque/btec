# Implementation of Website Design [P5]

Once the design stage was complete, I started the process of implementing it as a real website, using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript computing languages. As mentioned in the [M3 task](#3), I adhered to recent specification published by the W3C &ndash; the World Wide Web Consortium. This included HTML5; CSS3; and ECMAScript 6, the standard which JavaScript is an implementation of. I used the popular text editor Sublime Text 2 to build the website, using third-party plugins such as Emmet and integration with Git to improve workflow.

# Employing Good Practice in Development [M3]

I made sure to follow HTML5 and CSS3 standards during the construction of the website. Following the current standards is an important responsibility of web developers, as they offer the most efficient methods of achieving certain goals and will theoretically offer the best compatibility between browsers. The source code of the website I created can be viewed using the developer tools in a modern browser (such as Mozilla Firefox), but it can also be viewed more easily online in its [Git repository](https://github.com/blieque/btec/blob/master/file/sites/20.2).

# Testing Phase [P6]

When building websites, it's important to test not just the final product, but the components of the website as they are developed in different browsers and using different operating systems. As different browsers use different parsing software and &ndash; more importantly &ndash; rendering engines, single websites can potentially display differently in different environments. By understanding different platforms and their requirements, one can cater for most devices from the beginning of development, but some less-obvious caveats can drastically change a website in a way that'll only be noticed during testing.

For a more complex website than that which I designed for the task, a testing grid could be used to track the process of testing and to track errors uncovered and confirmed in the website. For a website of the scale my own occupied, however, there is little testing to carried out. The website consists of only two page layouts, both of which are greatly similar. Server-side programming or scripting hasn't been used to generate the website markup dynamically, leaving the website to pre-generated static content and the user-agent. Below I have summarised how the website created behaves in four major browsers, covering both desktop and mobile platforms.
