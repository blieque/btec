## Hardware and the OS [P5] [P6]

### Building the PC

We built the PC using an Asus Micro-ATX motherboard, AMD CPU and Kingston HyperX DDR3 RAM. The steps we took are detailed below with images illustrating the process. More about the different components of a computer system can be found in the <a href="/btec/2.1" class="ref">Assignment 1</a> documentation.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.02.jpg">
	The left image shows the insertion of the power cable into the power supply. The switch is set to the off position for safety purposes. On the right the 12V ATX supplemental power supply connector can be seen being inserted into the socket on the motherboard. This provides extra power to the motherboard not supplied by the main 24-pin supply.

	The main delivery of power to the motherboard, using the ATX 24-pin power conenctor. The four right-most pins in this image can be detached from the connector for lower power motherboards that only require a 20-pin connection.This power cable and the supplemental 12V power shown above indirectly power the CPU, chipset, motherboard components, PCI slots and other peripheral ports. The RAM is shown behind, the addition of which is shown below.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.05.jpg">
	The insertion of SATA data and SATA power connectors (left to right) into a hard-disc drive. The particular model in our case was a Western Digital WD Green 500GB.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.06.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.07.jpg">
	The left shows the addition of RAM to the system, by way of being placed into one of the two DIMM slots on the motherboard. On the right, SATA data connectors can be seen above the six SATA headers on the motherboard. Only the data connector appears on the motherboard, as SATA power for drives originates from the power supply.

	RAM being pushed downwards into the motherboard. In order to do so, the clips either side must be opened, which will flick back and hold the RAM module in when one is inserted. The force required to make this clips function can alarm some, but motherboards are designed to take the strain.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.10.jpg">
	Starting the computer by creating a connection between the power+ and power- F-PANEL header pins. This header area of the motherboard is intended to accommodate the connectors provided by a computer case front panel, which almost always has a power button. As we were not using a case, we had to manually complete the circuit that the power button usually would. The F-PANEL header also houses pins that carry hard-drive activity data (usually to an LED on the case) as well as reset switch pins. We also checked the power and data connections for the optical and hard-disc drives.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.11.jpg">
	The computer successfully booted, using the installation of Windows 7 already on the drive. We later formatted the disc and installed the Windows 10 Technical Preview. We used a USB mouse and keyboard to control the computer.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.12.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.13.jpg">
	The computer progressed easily to the desktop and we started to partially configure the pre-installed OS. Having had issues with the keyboard we were using initially, we used a different model and connected to a different USB port.

	Changing the time after clicking the clock in the bottom-right of the screen, and then "Change date and time settings...". We used another computer and the website <a href="http://time.is">time.is</a>, which provides an accurate, updating clock. We entered a time ~15 seconds ahead of reality, and clicked OK when the actual time caught up, leaving the computer's clock accurate within at most a fifth of a second.

	Using anti-static wrist-bands helps to ensure that static electricity generated by working does not damage the components being handled. Inside the band is a small metal plate that touches the wearers skin, and this connects to a wire with a connector on the end. This can be attached to a standard crocodile-clip and then attached to a large, bare metal object or ground lead. The image to the right shows the selection of a specific boot drive when installing an operating system from a DVD.

### Installing the OS; Windows 10 Technical Preview

The hard-drive we used for the build had already be used to run WIndows 7, but we decided to move forward to Windows 10 Technical Preview. Although still in the development stage, the preview allowed us to benefit from new performance improvements and better hardware support. The installed the OS by booting the machine from a disc with the Windows 10 ISO disc image burned onto it.

<div class="i h">

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.18.jpg">
	Selecting the correct language and keyboard preference, and then partitioning the hard drive during the installation of Windows. We deleted the two Windows 7 partitions on the drive already, and created a single, new NTFS-formatted partition for the new installation. Upon continuing with the installation Windows added another partition before ours, filling about 300 MB. This partition is used by Windows for particularly important system files.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.19.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.20.jpg">
	The left shows Windows being installed. The vast majority of this process is merely copying and extracting files from their compressed format on the installation disc to the actual HDD in the computer. Once this was complete, the system automatically rebooted and launched the Windows 10 setup. Here we configured various options to improve privacy for the end user. This related mostly to advertising and data collection.

	Upon being prompted to, we chose to customise the setting that would decide what data was sent to Microsoft. We chose to opt-out of as much as we could, as the computer was not going to see consistent use. This would mean that any data sent would be anomalous and would affect the accuracy of true usage statistics that Microsoft intends to collect.

</div>
<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.22.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.23.jpg">
	The next step of the installation involved creating a user profile. We used "password" for the password so as not to prevent others from using the installation in the future, and set a password hint saying this. In reality, it is best to use a password of eight characters or longer, and include symbols, punctuation, numbers and both upper- and lowercase text. In reality, the files on the drive are not encrypted by default, and could very easily be extracted using a Linux distribution on a USB stick and the motherboards boot menu.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.24.jpg">
	Part of the installation involved Windows installing some basic apps from the Windows Store introduced with Windows 8. As the computer was not connected to the internet, this likely just involved installing packages already stored in a compressed format on the installation disc.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div> 
</div>
<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.25.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.26.jpg">
	Unsure if the correct drivers were being used for each hardware component and that newer versions weren't available in the OS that were not already in use, we opened the Device Manager. Had we been able to connect to the internet, this utility would have queried the Microsoft driver database for newer versions, and updated any affected drivers, but in our case it merely searched the driver library Windows includes for suitable software. The Device Manager in Windows can be most easily accessed by opening the start menu and typing "device". We also opened the date and time settings window in order to check that the system time was accurate.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.27.jpg">
	Although the operating system had only just been installed and the drive formatted prior to that, we decided to run a disc defragmentation on the main drive. The drive was found to be less than 5% fragmented, as expected, but we ran the algorithm nevertheless to ensure the computer performed as well as it could.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div> 
</div>
<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.28.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.29.jpg">
	Time on the machine also needed to be adjusted, a involving a process we had performed on the older Windows 7 installation. Using the web once more to find an accurate and updating clock, we adjusted the time by typing a value several seconds ahead of time and submitting the value once the actual time matched it. We also opened the control panel to change to the desktop resolution, also accessible by right-clicking the desktop and then clicking "Screen resolution".
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.30.jpg">
	Presumably due to the lack of an internet connection, the drivers for the on-board video chip were not installed, and were not pre-packaged with Windows. For this reason, we were not able to select any screen resolution other than 1024 &times; 768, which caused a stretch of content horizontally when displayed on the monitor we were using.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.31.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.1.32.jpg">
	Because the start menu shortcuts can be slow to access, and the taskbar can become crowded when adding several shortcuts, we added a desktop shortcut for the Windows Store, allowing a user to install new software with ease. Due to the lack of an internet connection, we were not able to load any content.

	The "Devices and Printers" window in Windows. This is where one would go in order to install a printer (using either the <em>Add a device</em> or <em>Add a printer</em> button above the icons) not automatically installed when plugged in. This also allows one to access the properties of devices attached to the system, which in turn allows a myriad of settings to be changed, such as the functionality of buttons on a mouse, macros on a keyboard and default printing options. <div>Image taken by myself or group member.

## Testing the System [P7]

| Test	| Expected Outcome	| Actual Outcome	| Further Action	|
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Are the time and date both correctly configured? | Yes, and [time.is](http://time.is/) reports the clock as exact. | As expected | None required |
| Are paper sizes set up correctly for printing? | WTFF? | WTFF? | WTFF? |
| Do all the desktop shortcuts work? | Yes, as Windows implements complex and efficient file tracking once shortcuts have been created. This means that a file may move, and any shortcuts on the system will be updated, even without the current user having write permissions. A shortcut will break if the file it points to is deleted, however, and if it has an alert will be shown asking if the user would like to remove the shortcut if the user clicks it. | As expected | None required |
| Are all the necessary hardware drivers installed? | Functional drivers have been installed, meaning that Windows does not show any errors in the Device Manager. The only drivers available, however, can have been those on the Windows installation disc, as the installation computer was not connected to the internet when we installed the OS. Official or more up-to-date drivers may be available on the AMD, Intel or Nvidia websites than those that were on the computer. | We were fairly certain that the drivers installed were either marginally out of date or not official software, so we decided to rectify this. | Using the device manager to find the model of the video chip, we looked for the Intel [support and download](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) pages online on another computer. We entered the model number and downloaded the supplied executable installer. We placed the file on a removable USB stick, and then moved it to the Windows 10 PC's downloads directory. From here we ran the installer, and then rebooted the machine to ensure the new drivers had been installed. |
| "Default folder directories" | WTAFF? | WTAFF? | WTAFF? |
| Does the CPU and/or GPU exceed acceptable temperatures when under load (using Prime95 and SpeedFan)? | I would imagine that the CPU would reach high temperatures (around 80&deg;C) as the CPU heatsink likely hadn't be reseated with new thermal paste in several years. | In testing, the temperature reached a maximum of 84&deg;C, after 10 minutes of full load operation. We did not test with a graphical benchmarking application as we had not installed a dedicated video card, and the onboard graphics would undoubtedly be low-performance and likely not include a temperature sensor. | In order to improve the temperature of the CPU under load, the CPU heatsink would likely need to be reseated. This would involve undoing the four screws around the CPU socket; carefully removing the backplate behind the motherboard; removing the heatsink from the CPU by gently twisting; cleaning the copper plate and CPU with strong isopropyl alcohol and tissues; drying the components and applying new thermal paste in the centre of the CPU (about a pea-sized amount); evenly lowering the heatsink over the CPU once more; then finally fastening the heatsink screws to the backplate in an *X* pattern to ensure an even distribution of paste across the CPU. |

## Routine Maintenance [P8]

### Guide: Defragmentation

Windows includes a defragmentation program by default, which can be used to defragment any filesystem that Windows is able to read and write to. This excludes, for example, ext4 filesystems, but these do not require defragmentation in order to maintain optimal performance. The steps below outline the process of using the default Windows defragmenter to improve drive read/write speeds.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.3.1.jpg">
	1. Open the start menu and click *Control Panel*.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.3.2.jpg">
	2. Type "defr" into the search box in the top right of the window that appears, and then click *Defragment your hard drive*.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.3.3.jpg">
	3. The Windows Disk Defragmenter will appear. From the list, select a hard-disc drive (as opposed to an SSD, which should never be defragmented), and then click *Analyse disk* in order to update the fragmentation percentage to better judge whether or not to defragment the drive or click *Defragment drive* to immediately begin defragmentation.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.3.4.jpg">
	4. One can also click *Turn on schedule...* in the top right, which allows you to configure a regular defrag time and which drives should be included in this process.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>

### Guide: Removal of Temporary Files

As an operating system is used temporary files are frequently created. These allow images on the web, for example, to be cached, meaning they don't need to be downloaded whenever they're required by a webpage. Image caching is designed to improve the speed at which web pages load and reduce the data consumption of browsing.

Although caching has a positive impact on browsing speed, it can have a negative impact on general computer performance. The files downloaded fill space on the hard-drive, which can lead to more severe fragmentation. In order to improve the speed of a computer overall, these temporary files can be deleted without relying on the browser that created them to do so. Valuable disc space can also be freed, allowing more user files to be stored and programs installed.

In order to easily remove files that the system has created over time, follow the steps below.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.1.jpg">
	1. Open the start menu and click *Control Panel*.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.2.jpg">
	2. Type "temp" into the search box in the top right of the window that appears, and then click *Free up disk space by deleting unnecessary files*.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.3.jpg">
	3. Pick a drive available to the system that you would like to remove temporary files from. In the majority of systems, this will just be the `C:\` drive.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.4.jpg">
	4. Click *OK* and the system will begin to scan for files on the selected drive that are no longer needed.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.5.jpg">
	5. Next a window will ask you which types of files should be removed. If you wish not to lose game statistics for any pre-installed Microsoft games, this option can be un-ticked neat the top of the list.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.4.6.jpg">
	6. Click *OK* and then *Delete files* to begin the actual deletion process. This may take several minutes, but you should notice more free space on the drive selected once the process has completed.
	<div>Image taken by myself or group member. See <a href="/btec/license">license</a>.</div>
</div>

### Guide: Enable Automatic Updates

Updates are frequently released for Windows by Microsoft in order to protect the data and identity of the operating system's users, as well as to provide performance improvements. Updating can be made automatic by changing some setting in the Control Panel, as shown below.

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.5.1.jpg">
	1. Open the start menu and click *Control Panel*.

## Evaluation of the System [M3]

Despite having high-end hardware components and professional grade software, a system may still fail to achieve the purpose it was needed for. For example, a user that suffers from arthritis may find it difficult to use the computer at a typical computer desk, and may find a more flexible form of computer, such as laptop or tablet, more appropriate. Below, the system we built is analysed in terms of being fit for purpose, both from hardware and software points of view.

### Hardware Specifications

The system we build using hardware components had low-end to medium-range parts. A list is shown below:

| Category		| Model					|
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Motherboard	| Asus M5A78L-M LX PLUS |
| CPU			| AMD Athlon X2 340 |
| Memory (RAM)	| 2GB DDR3 Kingston HyperX Blu |
| Video Card	| AMD 760G integrated |
| HDD Storage	| 500 GB Western Digital WD Green |
| Power Supply	| Generic 400 Watt |
| Optical Drive | Samsung CD/DVD Reader/Writer |

<div class="n">Not all of the components listed above are entirely accurate. For example, I believe the motherboard was an older model to any of those listed at <a href="http://uk.pcpartpicker.com">PCParkPicker</a>.</div>

These hardware specifications aren't top-of-the-range by any means, but they do still offer potential as an effective personal computer. In reality, one could make the most of a system like this by installing a less demanding operating system than WIndows on the machine, such as Linux. Particular distributions of Linux are even targeted specifically towards lower-end, perhaps dated hardware, such as Lubuntu, which achieves good performance by minimising the number of background processes and using a light-weight set of software packages by default.

The hardware components mean that a user could read and write data from and to optical discs, which may be useful as a graphic designer when creating presentations to showcase work to a client. It also provides enough power to expand in the future. Should the user(s) decide to add a dedicated video card to the PC, they would be able to do so easily, without drawing more power from the PSU than it is rated to supply.

### OS Configuration and Suitability

#### Screen Resolution

We configured the screen resolution as high as the system would allow. The most important part of setting a screen resolution is that the ratio of width to height of the graphics output matches that of the monitor, even if the pixel count is different. This ensures that the items on screen will not become distorted (e.g., a circle becoming an oval). As the primary use of the system would be graphic design, the screen resolution would be essential in practise, and would need to be correct. I am confident that with an internet connection, the correct drivers for the graphics chip in the AMD 760G chipset could have been installed, which would have enabled full resolution and possibly even HD output, given a compatible monitor.

As the computer would be in use by a person with poor eyesight, I would consider the use of the correct screen resolution imperative as well. Already being hard of sight, the second user of the system could easily become confused with distorted and blurred information. Using the largest output dimensions supported by the monitor would allow the user to see items on screen as clearly as possible, and would make increasing the font size more effective.

In terms of screen resolution, I believe the system would meet the requirements of the user, once correct drivers were installed.

#### Mouse

The mouse settings were left as the defaults packaged with Windows, although many users find this to be slow. A graphic designer may need a slower mouse cursor for making more precise movements when completing design work, leading us to leave the settings as they were. The need for a slow cursor sensitivity could be negated by using a mouse with a high-precision laser sensor, which would allow for much finer control at a single-pixel level.

The mouse sensitivity would also be more suitable for the user with worse eyesight. The cursor may be easier to track for the user as it would move slower around the screen, and this would make clicking within small areas less of a hassle. Having noticed that the vast majority of the content typically viewed on computers, and therefore behind the mouse cursor, was white or at least light-coloured, we decided to change the colour of the mouse cursor to black, improving contrast between the cursor and the content on screen. This can be done by navigating to the Control Panel, and searching for "mouse". In the mouse settings dialogue box, there is an option to change the mouse cursor used by Windows. As cursor settings are user-specific it would make sense to add users for each real user of the system, meaning they can each change the settings to what works best for them.

In terms of mouse sensitivity and cursor appearance, I believe the system would meet the requirements of the user(s).

#### Font Sizes

In order that the text on screen and other graphical features such as buttons would be easily visible and clear to the user with poor eyesight, the text size on the system was changed. This can be done by following the steps in the guide at the end of the P6 task. This makes the Windows UI a lot easier to read for many, and is user-specific like the mouse cursors mentioned above. This means that with separate user accounts, the different people using the computer could configure their own settings to best suit their preference.

### User Requirements Overall

Honestly, I don't believe that the PC could have met the requirements of the user in practical use. Although the screen resolution; mouse sensitivity and appearance; and text settings could all be altered to best suit the users, the hardware in the system was simply too low-end. Using Linux and light-weight alternatives to the industry standard software packages such as Adobe Illustrator CC and Adobe Photoshop could yield good results, but I feel that the user would only spend more time trying to make the software behave as needed, and not be able to freely create.

To conclude, I would suggest that the designer instead spend more money and buy a more feature complete and powerful machine, such as one incorporating an Intel i7 CPU; AMD Radeon R9 280 or Nvidia GTX 900 series graphics card (or better); between 8 and 16 GB of RAM; and a more capable, reliable motherboard. This hardware would be able to run all of the necessary software and Windows without any problem, and possibly even run Mac OS X to an extent, which is regarded by many to be the standard in design.

## Potential Performance Improvements [D2]

### From Spec (temp.):

* Configuration for suitability
* Screen res., font size, voice recognition (dyslexia)
* Performance upgrades (hardware)
	* Faster CPU
	* More memory
	* More storage
	* Monitor (S220HQL!?)

Remember to explain and justify why your would make these improvements.
