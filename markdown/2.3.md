## Hardware and the OS [P5] [P6] [P8]

### Building the PC

We built the PC using an Asus Micro-ATX motherboard, AMD CPU and Kingston HyperX DDR3 RAM. The steps we took are detailed below with images illustrating the process. More about the different components of a computer system can be found in the <a href="/btec/2.1" class="ref">Assignment 1</a> documentation.

	The left image shows the insertion of the power cable into the power supply. The switch is set to the off position for safety purposes. On the right the 12V ATX supplemental power supply connector can be seen being inserted into the socket on the motherboard. This provides extra power to the motherboard not supplied by the main 24-pin supply.

	The main delivery of power to the motherboard, using the ATX 24-pin power conenctor. The four right-most pins in this image can be detached from the connector for lower power motherboards that only require a 20-pin connection.This power cable and the supplemental 12V power shown above indirectly power the CPU, chipset, motherboard components, PCI slots and other peripheral ports. The RAM is shown behind, the addition of which is shown below.

	The insertion of SATA data and SATA power connectors (left to right) into a hard-disc drive. The particular model in our case was a Western Digital WD Green 500GB.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.07.jpg">
	The left shows the addition of RAM to the system, by way of being placed into one of the two DIMM slots on the motherboard. On the right, SATA data connectors can be seen above the six SATA headers on the motherboard. Only the data connector appears on the motherboard, as SATA power for drives originates from the power supply.

	RAM being pushed downwards into the motherboard. In order to do so, the clips either side must be opened, which will flick back and hold the RAM module in when one is inserted. The force required to make this clips function can alarm some, but motherboards are designed to take the strain.

	Starting the computer by creating a connection between the power+ and power- F-PANEL header pins. This header area of the motherboard is intended to accommodate the connectors provided by a computer case front panel, which almost always has a power button. As we were not using a case, we had to manually complete the circuit that the power button usually would. The F-PANEL header also houses pins that carry hard-drive activity data (usually to an LED on the case) as well as reset switch pins. We also checked the power and data connections for the optical and hard-disc drives.

	The computer successfully booted, using the installation of Windows 7 already on the drive. We later formatted the disc and installed the Windows 10 Technical Preview. We used a USB mouse and keyboard to control the computer.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.13.jpg">
	The computer progressed easily to the desktop and we started to partially configure the pre-installed OS. Having had issues with the keyboard we were using initially, we used a different model and connected to a different USB port.

	Changing the time after clicking the clock in the bottom-right of the screen, and then "Change date and time settings...". We used another computer and the website <a href="http://time.is">time.is</a>, which provides an accurate, updating clock. We entered a time ~15 seconds ahead of reality, and clicked OK when the actual time caught up, leaving the computer's clock accurate within at most a fifth of a second.

	Using anti-static wrist-bands helps to ensure that static electricity generated by working does not damage the components being handled. Inside the band is a small metal plate that touches the wearers skin, and this connects to a wire with a connector on the end. This can be attached to a standard crocodile-clip and then attached to a large, bare metal object or ground lead. The image to the right shows the selection of a specific boot drive when installing an operating system from a DVD.

### Installing the OS; Windows 10 Technical Preview

The hard-drive we used for the build had already be used to run WIndows 7, but we decided to move forward to Windows 10 Technical Preview. Although still in the development stage, the preview allowed us to benefit from new performance improvements and better hardware support. The installed the OS by booting the machine from a disc with the Windows 10 ISO disc image burned onto it.

	Selecting the correct language and keyboard preference, and then partitioning the hard drive during the installation of Windows. We deleted the two Windows 7 partitions on the drive already, and created a single, new NTFS-formatted partition for the new installation. Upon continuing with the installation Windows added another partition before ours, filling about 300 MB. This partition is used by Windows for particularly important system files.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.19.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.20.jpg">
	The left shows Windows being installed. The vast majority of this process is merely copying and extracting files from their compressed format on the installation disc to the actual HDD in the computer. Once this was complete, the system automatically rebooted and launched the Windows 10 setup. Here we configured various options to improve privacy for the end user. This related mostly to advertising and data collection.

	Upon being prompted to, we chose to customise the setting that would decide what data was sent to Microsoft. We chose to opt-out of as much as we could, as the computer was not going to see consistent use. This would mean that any data sent would be anomalous and would affect the accuracy of true usage statistics that Microsoft intends to collect.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.22.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.23.jpg">
	The next step of the installation involved creating a user profile. We used "password" for the password so as not to prevent others from using the installation in the future, and set a password hint saying this. In reality, it is best to use a password of eight characters or longer, and include symbols, punctuation, numbers and both upper- and lowercase text. In reality, the files on the drive are not encrypted by default, and could very easily be extracted using a Linux distribution on a USB stick and the motherboards boot menu.

</div>
<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.24.jpg">
	Part of the installation involved Windows installing some basic apps from the Windows Store introduced with Windows 8. As the computer was not connected to the internet this likely just involved installing packages already stored in a compressed format on the installation disc.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.26.jpg">
	Unsure if the correct drivers were being used for each hardware component and that newer versions weren't available in the OS that were not already in use, we opened the Device Manager. Had we been able to connect to the internet, this utility would have queried the Microsoft driver database for newer versions, and updated any affected drivers, but in our case it merely searched the driver library Windows includes for suitable software. The Device Manager in Windows can be most easily accessed by opening the start menu and typing "device". We also opened the date and time settings window in order to check that the system time was accurate.

<div class="i">

	Although the operating system had only just been installed and the drive formatted prior to that, we decided to run a disc defragmentation on the main drive. The drive was found to be less than 5% fragmented, as expected, but we ran the algorithm nevertheless to ensure the computer performed as well as it could.

<div class="i h">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.28.jpg">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.29.jpg">
	Time on the machine also needed to be adjusted, a involving a process we had performed on the older Windows 7 installation. Using the web once more to find an accurate and updating clock, we adjusted the time by typing a value several seconds ahead of time and submitting the value once the actual time matched it. We also opened the control panel to change to the desktop resolution, also accessible by right-clicking the desktop and then clicking "Screen resolution".

<div class="i">
	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.30.jpg">
	Presumably due to the lack of an internet connection, the drivers for the on-board video chip were not installed, and were not pre-packaged with Windows. For this reason, we were not able to select any screen resolution other than 1024 &times; 768, which caused a stretch of content horizontally when displayed on the monitor we were using.

	<img src="/btec/img/2.3.32.jpg">
	Because the start menu shortcuts can be slow to access, and the taskbar can become crowded when adding several shortcuts, we added a desktop shortcut for the Windows Store, allowing a user to install new software with ease. Due to the lack of an internet connection, we were not able to load any content.

	The "Devices and Printers" window in Windows. This is where one would go in order to install a printer not automatically installed when plugged in. This also allows one to access the properties of devices attached to the system, which in turn allows a myriad of settings to be changed, such as the functionality of buttons on a mouse, macros on a keyboard and default printing options.

	This link found in Control Panel is one way to access settings for printers and other peripherals. This can also be accessed by searching in the start menu, for example.
