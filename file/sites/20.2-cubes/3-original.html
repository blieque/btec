			<div class="img" data-tooltip="Original Rubik's Cube, Circa 1980, 1981 Solving Guide"><img src="assets/img/05.jpg" alt="Original Rubik's cube from circa nineteen-eighty, with a nineteen-eighty-one solving guide"></div>

				<li>This cube was presumably manufactured some time during the 1980s, judging by quality, condition and sticker colours.</li>
				<li>The cube is shown atop a 1981 booklet guide to solving the cube.</li>
				<li>At the time this cube was manufactured, the speed-cubing community was in its infancy, and specially designed cubes were not common. This cube has very poor, high-friction turning as well as little corner-cutting, and is therefore more of collectors item than a usable cube.</li>
